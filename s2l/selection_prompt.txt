*******************

Above, you are shown 4 summaries. Identify the summary which best satisfies the following equally-important criteria:

1. Brief: Much quicker to read than the Article.
2. Precise: A high ratio of summary-worthy content to non summary-worthy.
3. Concise: The summary should synthesize, not regurgitate, the Article.
4. Informative: The main ideas are conveyed.
5. Self-Contained: The summary makes sense without the Article.

For this exercise, weight each criteria equally. Criteria 1-3 are biased toward short summaries while 4-5 are slighty biased toward longer summaries.

Choose a Summary by its number. Then, for this summary, rank the Criteria (by its number), starting with the criteria most satisfied by the chosen summary.
