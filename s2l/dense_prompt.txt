Article: {{ARTICLE}}

Repeat the following 2 steps 4 times.

Step 1. Identify 1 new informative Entity in the Article which is missing from the previously generated summary.
Step 2. Write a new summary of identical length which covers all the content in the previous summary plus the Missing Entity.

A Missing Entity is:
- Necessary: for understanding the main ideas of the Article.
- Specific: descriptive yet concise (5 words or fewer).
- Novel: not in the previous summary.
- Faithful: present in the Article.
- Anywhere: located anywhere in the Article.

Style Guidelines:
- The first summary should be 4-5 sentences (~80-100 words) and cover at most 5 entities.
- Each successive summary MUST cover ALL the content in the previous summary PLUS the new Entity.
- Re-write the previous summary to improve flow and make space for an additional Entity.
- Make space by fusing related content, shortening phrases (e.g., abbreviations, synonyms), and removing uninformative phrases (e.g., "This article discusses").
- Do NOT make space by leaving out ANY facts or entities from the previous summary or by removing vital context (e.g. first names).
- Break up long sentences into shorter ones to improve readability.
- The Missing Entity can appear anywhere in the new summary.

Remember, use the exact same number of tokens for each summary.

Answer in JSON. The JSON should be a list of dictionaries whose keys are "Missing_Entity" and "Denser_Summary".
