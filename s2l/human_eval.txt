(CNN)  -- A tugboat on Saturday reached a disabled freighter carrying 22 people, hours after the ship rode out Hurricane Ike without power, Coast Guard spokesman Mike O'Berry said. O'Berry said the tugboat Rotterdam arrived shortly before 2 p.m. (3 p.m. ET). Repairs will be made aboard the Antalina, which has a broken fuel pump, while at sea, O'Berry said. The tugboat will then tow the ship to Port Arthur, Texas, where it will undergo additional repairs and eventually offload more of its cargo -- petroleum coke, a petroleum byproduct -- O'Berry said. The crew members aboard the Antalina, a Cypriot-flagged freighter, are all in good health, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Ron Labrec. The freighter suffered no major damage from the storm, said Darrell Wilson, a spokesman for the company that manages the ship. Aircraft from the Coast Guard and Air Force were sent Friday afternoon to try to rescue the crew of the freighter, which is loaded with petroleum coke, a petroleum byproduct. But high winds forced the military to abort the rescue, O'Berry said. The Coast Guard then instructed the freighter to contact it each hour. It also told told the crew to turn on the ship's emergency radio beacon so its position could be monitored, O'Berry said.  Watch the Coast Guard conduct a rescue operation » . Onshore as well, rescuers found it too dangerous to respond to calls for help. In Liverpool, Texas, south of Houston, a family called for help around 1 a.m. Saturday when a tree crashed into their house, but authorities concluded that strong winds made it too dangerous to respond, said Doc Adams, Brazoria County's emergency management coordinator. "You want to take care of people, and when you can't, it's tough," Adams said. "Unfortunately, someone has to make the decision about whether the risk is worth the benefit. Are you willing to risk three or four lives to save one? It's not easy." Adams said he didn't know if anyone in the house was hurt. "As far as I know, they're still there in the house with a tree over it," he said at about 3:40 a.m. The stranded freighter had been headed south through the Gulf of Mexico from Port Arthur, Texas, but "lost main propulsion 90 miles southeast of Galveston" and was unable to steer, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard received a distress call from the vessel at 4 a.m. Friday. The Antalina was "basically adrift, at the mercy of the wind and sea currents," Coast Guard Petty Officer Tom Atkeson said at the time. "We are in hell," one of the men aboard the freighter told CNN on Friday before the rescue was called off. The man said the winds around the ship were strong but that the freighter still had power. On Friday before the storm hit, authorities picked up more than 120 people stranded by rising seas along the southeast Texas coast. Most of the rescues occurred in Galveston County, where rising water and other effects of the storm began hours before landfall early Saturday. Stranded residents were airlifted from Crystal Beach, Bolivar Peninsula and other communities in the Galveston area. Many of those rescued were motorists stranded on flooded roads. In Surfside Beach, police waded through chest-high rushing water to rescue five people trapped in their homes. One man refused to leave, said Surfside Beach police Chief Randy Smith. "Some of them took convincing, some of them didn't," Smith said. Police also rescued five other people who waded out to meet the officers. About half of those rescues were done by helicopters out of bases along the coast, said Coast Guard Petty Officer David Schulein. Three HH-65C helicopters from Coast Guard Air Station Houston rescued more than 20 people and continued to fly rescue missions until weather grounded them Friday evening, said Petty Officer Renee Aiello, a station spokeswoman. Some 37,000 people may need to be rescued in the aftermath of the hurricane, a U.S. military official estimated Friday. Texas already has asked for help, and the active-duty military has 42 search-and-rescue helicopters on standby, the official said.

Summary A: During Hurricane Ike, the Antalina, a freighter carrying 22 people and a cargo of petroleum coke, was left disabled and adrift due to a broken fuel pump. After receiving a distress call, the Coast Guard, as reported by spokesman Mike O'Berry, sent a tugboat to reach the ship, conduct repairs at sea, and tow it to Port Arthur, Texas for further repairs and cargo offloading. Despite initial rescue attempts by the Coast Guard and Air Force, high winds forced the military to abort the mission. Meanwhile, onshore in Texas, emergency management faced challenges in responding to calls for help due to the dangerous conditions.

Summary B: A tugboat reached a disabled freighter carrying 22 people, which had been stranded due to Hurricane Ike. The freighter, named the Antalina, had a broken fuel pump and will be repaired at sea before being towed to Port Arthur, Texas for further repairs and to offload its cargo of petroleum coke. Despite the storm, the crew members are in good health and the freighter suffered no major damage.

MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- A car bomb exploded Friday morning in Spain's northern Basque region, killing a police officer inside the vehicle, officials said. Police investigate the vehicle destroyed by a car bomb in Spain's Basque region. Spain's Prime Minister blamed the attack on the Basque separatist group ETA, although there was no warning call before the explosion, as often happens in ETA attacks. The car exploded at 9:05 a.m. (3:05 a.m. ET) in an open-air parking lot in the Basque town of Arrigorriaga and damaged five other cars. Firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze, and police moved in to investigate. The Spanish national police officer killed was Eduardo Puelles, said the new Basque regional president, Patxi Lopez. "ETA showed us the road to pain," Lopez said on national TV. "We will show them the road to prison." The officer was a senior figure in the fight against ETA and the explosion was caused by a limpet bomb placed underneath the car, officials told CNN partner station CNN+. A limpet bomb is one that is stuck to the underside of vehicle. Arrigorriaga is about 30 miles south of the largest Basque city of Bilbao. ETA's last fatal victim was a businessman who was shot dead in the same region last December. "My stance to stop ETA is unbreakable, so that people in the Basque country and Spain can live in peace, to halt this barbarity," said Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, after the attack. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its more than four decades of fighting for Basque independence. The European Union and the United States list it as a terrorist group. ETA has threatened Lopez, who is a socialist and the first non-nationalist Basque president in 30 years. He has also vowed to stop the group. There are about 600 ETA members or suspected members in Spanish jails and 150 others in French jails, authorities in both countries have told CNN.

Summary A: A car bomb explosion in Spain's northern Basque region killed a police officer, an attack that the Prime Minister has attributed to the Basque separatist group ETA. The officer killed was a senior figure in the fight against ETA, and the incident has reinforced the government's resolve to halt the group's activities, which have resulted in over 800 deaths in its four-decade fight for Basque independence.

Summary B: A car bomb, attributed to the Basque separatist group ETA, exploded in Spain's northern Basque region, killing a police officer named Eduardo Puelles. The incident was confirmed by the new Basque regional president, Patxi Lopez.

(CNN) -- Capt. Chesley Sullenberger, the hero pilot who safely landed a full passenger jet in the Hudson River, was once again honored with cheers and applause Tuesday during a ceremony for him hosted by the governor of his home state. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger a flag and license plate. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, first lady Maria Shriver and other dignitaries greeted Sullenberger at the state Capitol rotunda in Sacramento. Taking a break from difficult negotiations over a troubled state budget, the governor presented Sullenberger with a jacket with the state seal, a California state flag that had flown over the state Capitol, a proclamation and a "California Hero" license plate. "Today is a very important day," Schwarzenegger said. "There are legislators upstairs that are negotiating and working on a budget -- [we] need a great hero in a state capitol." The Sullenberger family lives in Danville, California. Sullenberger's response was understated -- as it has been at other ceremonies, including a New York City Hall event when he was given the key to the city by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. "On behalf of the other four crew members of Flight 1549 and also on behalf of the many thousands of aviation professionals whose daily devotion to duty keeps air travel safe, I gratefully accept this recognition," he said. Sullenberger and his crew safely landed the damaged airplane, believed to have hit a flock of birds, in the Hudson on January 15. All 155 passengers aboard the US Airways flight survived. CNN's Scott Thompson contributed to this report.

Washington (CNN) -- Current and past first ladies Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and Nancy Reagan will attend a memorial service Tuesday in California for former first lady Betty Ford. The White House announced that Obama would travel to Palm Desert, California, for the Tuesday service, which will be followed by a private funeral Thursday in Michigan. Clinton, the current secretary of state, will be accompanied Tuesday by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, an aide told CNN. Reagan also will attend the California service at St. Margaret's Episcopal Church in Palm Desert, a Reagan Foundation official said. Former President George W. Bush also will attend the service but without his wife, former first lady Laura Bush, who had previous travel commitments, according to a spokesman. Bush's mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, will attend the Michigan funeral, the spokesman said. Following the Tuesday service, Ford's remains will lie in repose at the church until midnight, then be flown on Wednesday to Michigan to the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, according to a website on the memorial plans. Ford's remains will then lie in repose there beginning at 7 p.m. local time, said a statement posted on the website. On Thursday, Ford's private funeral will be held at Grace Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids, the statement on the website said. Ford, who died Friday at age 93, raised awareness of issues involving women's rights, cancer, alcoholism and substance abuse during and after her stint as first lady. Her late husband, former President Gerald Ford, died in 2006. The alcohol and substance abuse treatment center in Rancho Mirage, California, that bears her name has become one of the best-known facilities of its kind in the country. In remarks to reporters Monday, Clinton said she was "grateful for having known" Ford. "Her commitment to speaking out on issues that, before she took them on, were just not discussed made a huge difference in the lives of Americans," Clinton said. "I remember well when my mother's best friend was dying of breast cancer, nobody talked about it in those days," Clinton continued. "But Betty Ford made it acceptable" to discuss the issue in public. Also planning to be in California for the Tuesday service are protesters from the Westboro Baptist Church of Kansas, which cited on its website what it called Ford's infidelity by divorcing a first husband to marry Gerald Ford. The church is known for publicity seeking protests at funerals of U.S. soldiers and others to promote its radical conservative Christian agenda. CNN's Elise Labott and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.

Summary A: Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Nancy Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush will attend the memorial service for former first lady Betty Ford in California.

(CNN) -- Phil Donahue has rarely shied away from controversy. On his long-running syndicated talk show, he debated issues including abortion and the death penalty, and his MSNBC show was canceled in 2003, he maintained, because of his antiwar stand. Phil Donahue, right, made "Body of War" about disabled veteran Tomas Young, seated. Now the former talk show host has co-directed and co-produced an independent film, "Body of War," about a disabled Iraq war veteran, Tomas Young, who questions the conflict's rationale. Young joined the military after the September 11 attacks and was sent to Iraq. After less than a week there, he was shot in the spine, paralyzing him from the waist down. "Body of War" is the story of his coming home and adjusting to his new reality. The film has earned excellent reviews and was named best documentary of 2007 by the National Board of Review. It airs on The Sundance Channel on Tuesday night.  Watch Donahue talk about politics and war » . Donahue talked about "Body of War" and the recent presidential election on "American Morning" with CNN's Carol Costello. CNN: What did you hope to prove by [making "Body of War"]? Phil Donahue: Well, this work by ... Ellen Spiro and Phil Donahue is our attempt to show the harm in harm's way. In the middle of the most sanitized war of my lifetime, nobody sees this pain. These people are all below the radar. What you see in our film is a drama taking place behind the closed doors of thousands of homes in this country. I'm telling you, less than 5 percent of us have sacrificed, and the American people are not seeing this. I think this is a shame. CNN: Well, let's see some of that. We're going to show a clip right now. (Begin video clip) Tomas Young: When I made the phone call on September 13, it was because I saw the pictures of [President Bush] standing on top of the pile, saying that we were going to smoke the evildoers out that did this to us. All that had to happen so I could fly 10,000 miles away to not shoot around, because all I saw were women and children running away from gunfire, before I took a bullet myself. (End video clip) CNN: Got a lot of wonderful reviews already. I just want to ask you what your hope is for when Barack Obama takes office for veterans of the Iraq war. Donahue: Well, he will stop the pretense. He will stop it immediately. Oh, the troops, the troops, we love the troops ... [but] the troops come home and the V[eterans] A[dministration] doesn't call them back. We have to stop all this. We think if we say it, it's true. So, I see Barack Obama as -- first of all, the smile alone is going to restore this nation to the world's family of nations. ... They're going to be fascinated with the guy, and he is going to exploit this special attention to the benefit of this nation. I am pumped. CNN: The bar is high for him. Donahue: Yes. CNN: He's got the weight of the world on his shoulders. Phil Donahue, thank you for joining us. Donahue: Thank you, Carol.

Summary A: Phil Donahue and Ellen Spiro co-directed and co-produced 'Body of War,' a film about Tomas Young, a disabled Iraq war veteran who questions the conflict's rationale. The film, which has received excellent reviews and was named the best documentary of 2007 by the National Board of Review, airs on The Sundance Channel.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- A blossoming of cinematic creativity has swept Argentina in recent years, bringing about a second golden age of film. Pablo Trapero's latest movie "Lion's Den" stars Martina Gusman (left) and was in competition at Cannes. In Argentina, the renaissance marks a return to form for a cinematic tradition that was prolific and highly successful until creativity was stifled by a succession of military regimes that began with the ascendancy of Juan Peron in the 1940s. A revival occurred after the country returned to democracy in 1983 as filmmakers focused on life under the military dictatorship -- Luiz Puenzo's "The Official Story" (1985) won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. But an economic malaise ensued, turning off the taps to film financing. An economic boom in the 1990s quickly turned unstable, resulting in a crippling financial crisis earlier this decade that plunged Argentina into its worst recession ever. Out of the chaos, a new group of Argentina filmmakers emerged. The leaders of the so-called "New Argentine Cinema" have become critical contributors to the wider Latin American film movement that has captivated international critics and audiences alike. What's fueling New Argentine Cinema? Argentina's economy has recovered remarkably since its collapse in 2001, and the national film institute, Instituto Nacional de Cine y Artes Audiovisuales (INCAA), has been keen to foster the industry's development. The combination of cheap production costs and a flourishing artistic community has made Buenos Aires a hub of creativity. Already one of the most cosmopolitan cities in South America, the city is attracting everyone from local bohemians to big Hollywood names. Francis Ford Coppola, the most recent notable to tap into the vibrant scene, opened an Argentine unit of his Zoetrope production company last year to film his Buenos Aires-set family drama "Tetro," which is anticipated to be released next year. What movies are creating buzz? Pablo Trapero's "Lion's Den" about a woman who gives birth and raises her child in prison was nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year. Trapero is best known for his depiction of ordinary people. He gained acclaim with "Crane World" (1999) -- a gritty look at Argentina's working class -- and is widely considered one of Argentina's leading directors. Also in competition at Cannes this year was "The Headless Woman" from the ever subtle Lucrecia Martel. The film focuses on a woman's guilt after a hit-and-run accident and like Martel's other works, offers up a dose of social criticism. Martel burst on the scene with her first movie "The Swamp" (2001), winner of the Alfred Bauer Award at the Berlin International Film Festival. Lucia Puenzo stirred debate with "XXY" (2007), an exploration of adolescent sexuality centered around the life of a teenage hermaphrodite. The daughter of award-winning Luiz Puenzo, Lucia took home the Critic Weeks Grand Prize at Cannes last year. Are you excited about Argentine cinema? What is your favorite movie or director? Enough with the dramas -- who makes Argentines laugh? Daniel Burman has cited Woody Allen as one of the auteurs he most admires, and the influence is quite clear in his work, in which his identity as a Jew in Argentina figures prominently. "Waiting for the Messiah" (2000), "Lost Embrace" (2004) and "Family Law" (2006) make up the trilogy of films about fatherhood for which he has gained praise. The young director's latest film "Empty Nest" (2008) takes a touching and comedic look at married life. What's this I hear about a Hollywood in Argentina? You're referring to Palermo Hollywood. No, it's not a Las Vegas casino but rather a neighborhood in Buenos Aires where many film and TV studios are based. A bohemian spirit distinguishes the neighborhood from its more polished cousin to the south, Palermo Soho. Once occupied by desolate factories and warehouses, the area is now humming with activity. An abundance of hip lounges, cafes and trendy restaurants keep the buzz going all day and through the night. How does Argentina figure in the Latin American film scene? As the Latin American film renaissance has gained stride, filmmakers across the region have become more interested in collaborating on projects. The end of military dictatorships which ruled Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s "created really interesting national cinemas that blossomed a little bit everywhere but also created a correlation between directors from different countries," Brazilian director Walter Salles told CNN earlier this year. Salles works frequently with Argentine directors. He co-produced Trapero's "Lion's Den" and Julia Solomonoff's "Sisters" (2005). Meanwhile, Eduardo Constantini Jr, of the philanthropic Constantini family in Argentina, recently launched a fund with the Weinstein Co. aimed at backing Latin American movies. He is also behind The Auteurs, an "online movie theater" where Web users can watch and discuss film. Is this boom going to run out of steam? The renaissance in Argentina has been building for some time, but it's only just hitting its stride now. Earlier films were mainly art house successes but now with the spotlight shining on Latin America cinema, Argentine films may start to connect more with international audiences. The country continues to attract productions, and there is a vast pool of talent that is being groomed to lead the next generation of auteurs. More than 12,000 undergraduates are currently studying film directing, scriptwriting and technical production, according to the INCAA. Five other must-see Argentine films . 1. "The Night of the Pencils" (Hector Olivera, 1986) 2. "Nine Queens" (Fabian Bielinsky, 2000) 3. "Son of the Bride" (Juan Jose Campanella, 2001) 4. "The Dog" (Carlos Sorin, 2004) 5. "The Holy Girl" (Lucrecia Martel, 2004)

Summary A: Argentina's cinematic renaissance, known as the New Argentine Cinema, has been fostered by the national film institute, Instituto Nacional de Cine y Artes Audiovisuales (INCAA). The revival marks a return to Argentina's prolific film tradition, which was stifled by military regimes in the 1940s. The combination of cheap production costs and a flourishing artistic community has made Buenos Aires a hub of creativity, attracting both local and international filmmakers, including Francis Ford Coppola. Among the films creating buzz is Pablo Trapero's 'Lion's Den', which was nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes. Other notable films include Lucrecia Martel's 'The Headless Woman' and Lucia Puenzo's 'XXY', both of which stirred debate and garnered international attention.

Summary B: Argentina is experiencing a second golden age of film, with a new wave of filmmakers emerging after the country's worst recession. The resurgence, known as "New Argentine Cinema", is being fueled by the country's economic recovery and the support of the national film institute, Instituto Nacional de Cine y Artes Audiovisuales (INCAA). Notable films include Pablo Trapero's "Lion's Den", Lucrecia Martel's "The Headless Woman", and Lucia Puenzo's "XXY", while Buenos Aires neighborhood Palermo Hollywood has become a hub for film and TV studios.

LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- Angry protests are a common sight in Pakistan. Crowds often gather to denounce the United States or the Pakistani government, which critics accuse of being an American puppet. AntiTaliban protesters in Lahore. But in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore this week, several hundred protesters gathered on a scorching day to take on a very different target: the Taliban. "I will fight them to my last breath and the last drop of my blood in my body. I'm not scared," vowed newspaper publisher Jugnu Mohsin. She was leading a crowd of several hundred students, artists, writers and others, chanting "the Taliban is the enemy of Islam" in Urdu. Public protests against the Taliban started cropping up in various Pakistani cities after a video emerged showing militants publicly flogging a teenage girl. The Taliban's recent declaration that the Pakistani government and judicial system are "unIslamic" has also outraged many educated Pakistanis. Neha Mehdi moved to Lahore to study. Now, she fears her way of life is being threatened by the Taliban. "I cannot give up my education, and I cannot give up the way I'm living," the 23-year-old student said. "These Talibans have ruined the reputation of Islam." "There were threats here also from the Taliban that if we gather they might just bomb us," Mehdi said.  Watch how the anti-Taliban movement is growing » . More than 250 miles away, Pakistan's military continued its assault against Taliban militants who want to impose a radical interpretation of Islamic law in the country's northwestern tribal regions. Pakistan's government recently signed a deal that would allow Islamic law, or sharia, in the tribal belt as long as the law was imposed in accordance with the country's constitution. Mehdi and others in Lahore fear that the Taliban's version of sharia -- which forbids girls from attending school, as well as music, poetry and dance -- is slowly creeping into Lahore, the center of Pakistani culture. "Our way of life is being threatened," said Kamiar Rokni, a fashion designer who took part in the protest. "And if we don't do anything about it, then you're just going to be sitting around and one day the way you live and what this country's all about is going to stand for nothing." Rokni said he fears the Taliban "want to change the way we exist." Lahore may be hundreds of miles away from the Taliban-held areas outside Islamabad, but it is no stranger to militant attacks. "Last year we lost 39 people in acts of terrorism and this year we have lost 17 people in Lahore alone," Lahore police Chief Parvez Rathore said. As he speaks, a heavily armed escort is one step behind the police chief even as he walks outside the walls of the city's police headquarters. In March, gunmen attacked a bus carrying the Sri Lankan national cricket team in Lahore, killing six Pakistani police officers and the team's driver. Weeks later, militants dressed in police uniforms stormed a police training center in the city, prompting an eight-hour stand-off with police. Eight cadets were killed during the March 30 siege, which the government blamed on Pakistan's Taliban. Police in Lahore said the attacks would not have been possible without local support. Residents say there is no doubt that the Taliban have support in Pakistan's second largest city. "They're here in Lahore, this is the thing," said Jamal Rahman, who plays guitar for the Lahore-based band, "Lal" which means "Red." "Little groups of the Taliban are going around and intimidating people, causing fear, telling women to cover up and if they don't they'll shoot them." Rahman and his cousin, Aider -- who plays flute for "Lal" -- are using their music to rally society against what he says is a growing threat by the Taliban. "We want to try to get people aware, and try to get people activated and motivated to fight against this militancy," he said. It is unclear if the protests and rallying cries from Rahman and the others in Lahore are the start of a mass movement or simply the swan song of Pakistan's wealthy, urban elite who could be the first to leave if the suicide bombers and insurgents succeed in further destabilizing the country. Either way, their message is a sign that more Pakistanis believe the Taliban's threat is directed at them, and not just a reaction to the so-called U.S.-led "war on terror." Mehdi said she fears her life as a student could come to a violent end if the people of Lahore do not stand up to Islamic extremists. "If the Taliban take over then I'll be on the road being flogged by one of them like they did in Swat and I don't want that," she said. Some Pakistanis are resorting to violence to defend their turf. More than 30 people were killed in the southern port city of Karachi this week as members of the city's Mahajir ethnic majority group engaged in deadly clashes with ethnic Pashtuns. The Taliban is a mostly Pashtun movement. The government in Karachi has issued a "shoot on sight" order to security forces, to try to maintain calm in the city. A week before the clashes erupted, a leader of the MQM political party, which represents the Mahajir community in Karachi, said his supporters would fight back against what he called the "Talibanization" of his city. "You have to take the nasty decisions now," Haider Abbas Rizvi told CNN last week. "You have to take effective measures to control these Taliban ...otherwise the Taliban will take over."

Summary A: In Lahore, Pakistan, hundreds of protesters, led by newspaper publisher Jugnu Mohsin, gathered to denounce the Taliban. The protesters, including students, artists, and writers, were sparked by the Taliban's public flogging of a teenage girl and their declaration that the Pakistani government and judicial system are 'unIslamic'. Among the protesters was Neha Mehdi, a 23-year-old student who fears her way of life is being threatened by the Taliban.

Summary B: Protests against the Taliban have erupted in Lahore, Pakistan, led by students, artists, writers, and others who fear the Taliban's radical interpretation of Islamic law is threatening their way of life. The protests began after a video emerged showing militants publicly flogging a teenage girl and the Taliban declared the Pakistani government and judicial system as "unIslamic". Despite the government signing a deal to allow Islamic law in the tribal belt, many fear the Taliban's version of the law, which forbids girls from attending school and bans music, poetry, and dance, is creeping into Lahore, the cultural center of Pakistan.

Article:
(CNN) -- As Democratic and Republican presidential candidates scour the country for votes during the 2008 campaign, they'll inevitably court the Hispanic community, a voting group growing rapidly in number and diversity. Some Democratic presidential candidates pose before a debate sponsored by Univision. The Republican debate was postponed after only one candidate agreed to attend, a development which troubled some party leaders. The Hispanic vote is neither homogenous nor loyal to one party. Though the current political moment seems to favor the Democratic Party, experts say that affinity should not be taken for granted. The Hispanic community is the fastest-growing minority group in the United States, according to the U.S. census. But its percentage of the electorate is lower than its numbers as a whole because of lower citizenship rates, less voter participation and a youthful demographic. Of the nation's more than 44 million people of Hispanic origin, about a third are too young to vote. But all that's changing. Before the midterm elections in 2006, the Pew Hispanic Center, a Washington-based think-tank, estimated more than 17 million Hispanics would be eligible to vote in that election. The number represented a 7 percent increase from 2004. The Hispanic share of the U.S. electorate increased from 8.2 percent to 8.6 percent during the same period, Pew estimated. That percentage may grow even more by 2008 as a result of citizenship drives, get-out-the-vote campaigns and the natural growth of the community. Univision, the Spanish-language broadcast giant, has thrown its considerable weight behind a citizenship drive this year. "We feel that empowering our audience is good for Hispanics and the country," Univision President Ray Rodriguez told the Wall Street Journal in May 2007, adding that it was "a totally nonpartisan effort." Organizations such as the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, or NALEO, are also mobilizing the vote. "We have spearheaded a massive naturalization campaign and close to, I think, a million applications will have been submitted this fiscal year," said NALEO's executive director, Arturo Vargas. The change in the electorate could play a significant role in possible swing states like Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado and Florida during the 2008 election. There's a reason the Democratic Party decided to hold its presidential convention in Denver, experts said. "I don't think it's really registered with people just how influential the Latino vote can be in some of these state primaries," Vargas said. The Hispanic vote has historically been aligned with the Democratic Party, an allegiance established during the administrations of Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, said Harry Pachon of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute. That political alignment was further cemented when Proposition 187 -- designed to deny health care, education and welfare benefits to illegal immigrants -- was pushed by Republicans and passed in California in 1994. But the Republican Party, intent on gaining more Hispanic voters, made inroads during the early parts of this decade, culminating in the 2004 presidential campaign by President Bush. Exit polls showed he carried 40 to 44 percent of the Hispanic vote, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. "There are a lot of issues that Latinos agree with Republican philosophy," Pachon said, pointing to the GOP stances on entrepreneurship, fiscal policies, its appeal to Hispanic evangelicals and its policies toward Cuba. But the heated immigration debate, when many congressional Republicans disagreed with President Bush over granting a path toward citizenship for many illegal immigrants, may erode those gains. "The Republicans are really caught between a rock and a hard place," Pachon said. They must balance the interests of a segment of their constituency that is very anti-immigrant with the interests of a "Latino voter that is affluent and middle class, who can theoretically be reached by Republican Party principles," he said. It is little wonder then, that among Republican presidential candidates, only Arizona Sen. John McCain agreed to appear at an Univision debate scheduled for mid-September. The debate didn't happen. All but one of the Democratic contenders appeared for their debate. Some Republican leaders said last week not participating in such debates could harm the party's standing with minority groups for the 2008 election and beyond. "What are we going to do -- meet in a country club in the suburbs one day?" former congressman and GOP vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp told The Washington Post. "If we're going to be competitive with people of color, we've got to ask them for their vote." "This [political environment] gives Democrats a huge advantage," Adam J. Segal, who heads the Hispanic Voter Project at Johns Hopkins University, said in an e-mail. He also runs the 2050 Group, a multicultural public relations firm based in Washington. "They are likely to draw far more Hispanic votes than in 2004 and would gain at least a half-million vote advantage" under one of his group's more conservative scenarios, Segal said. But the Hispanic community is diverse and voting interests are not homogenous, which imperils such predictions. Hispanic immigrants originate from more than a dozen different countries, arrived in the U.S. through numerous immigration waves and have different perceptions of communal identity, Segal said. For example, a Cuban-American may vote Republican because of the GOP's long-standing policies toward Cuba, whereas a Puerto Rican voter in New York City or a voter in a border state may be driven by different motives. The culture of a state can also affect a Hispanic voter's behavior. A voter in Texas may be more conservative, whereas a voter with a similar background in California may be more liberal, Pachon said. There may also be generational cleavages, Pachon said. A study he conducted with a colleague on the impact of religion on the Latino vote revealed differences between first-, second- and third-generation Hispanics. The first and third generations said religion was more important to them when compared to the second generation. Additionally, despite the furor over immigration, that issue might not be the most important to Hispanic voters, NALEO's Vargas said. "If the election were held today, I think immigration would be a significant factor, but we're more than a year away from the election," he said. Based on a series of town hall meetings conducted in 2004 and conversations throughout this year, Vargas said education, the Iraq war, the economy and health care may take precedence over immigration. "We need to distinguish issues that matter to the Latino community versus the issues that matter to Latino voters," he said. "Those are not the same." E-mail to a friend .

Summary A: During the 2008 presidential campaign, both Democratic and Republican candidates targeted the Hispanic community, a rapidly growing and diverse voting group in the United States. Univision and the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) were instrumental in mobilizing the Hispanic vote. The changing electorate, particularly in potential swing states like Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado, and Florida, was a significant factor, leading the Democratic Party to hold its presidential convention in Denver.

Summary B: During the 2008 presidential campaign, both Democratic and Republican candidates sought to court the rapidly growing and diverse Hispanic community, a significant voting group. However, the Hispanic vote is not homogenous or loyal to one party, and while historically aligned with the Democratic Party, issues such as immigration, education, the Iraq war, the economy, and healthcare could influence voting decisions.

Article:
HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) -- "Che" the movie met Che the myth in Cuba this weekend, and the lengthy biopic of the Argentinean revolutionary won acclaim from among those who know his story best. Actor Benicio Del Toro stars in "Che," which details Che Guevara's role in the 1950s Cuban revolution. The movie was screened Saturday in the Yara movie theater in central Havana as part of the 30th International Festival of the New Latin American Cinema. "Che" also played Sunday at Havana's Karl Marx Theater. "Che" stars Oscar winner Benicio Del Toro in the title role, for which he won a best actor award at this year's Cannes Film Festival. But it's one thing to make a movie about Ernesto "Che" Guevara and the Cuban revolution and show it in France, quite another to screen it in Cuba. Speaking to CNN outside the Karl Marx Theater, the bilingual Puerto Rican actor admitted some anxiety. "This is Cuban history, so there's an audience in there that probably, that could be the biggest critics and the most knowledgeable critics of the historical accuracy of the film," Del Toro said.  Watch Del Toro talk about the movie in Cuba » . It appears he needn't have worried. Audiences gave the movie hearty ovations. And Granma, the official mouthpiece of the Cuban government, gave Del Toro a glowing review. "Del Toro personifies Che in a spectacular manner, not only his physical appearance but also his masterly interpretation," the state newspaper said. After the showing, Del Toro characterized the public reaction as "sensational, a shot of adrenaline," Granma said. "The dream was to make this movie and to bring it here, where it all began." The movie has two parts: "El argentino," which portrays Guevara's role in the 1950s Cuban revolution, and "Guerrilla," which shows Guevara's efforts in Africa and Bolivia, where he was killed in 1967. It was directed by Steven Soderbergh, who also directed Del Toro in the 2000 film "Traffic," for which Del Toro won an Oscar. At 4 hours and 17 minutes, "Che" can test viewers' stamina. But that wasn't a problem in Havana. It's a story Cubans know by heart. But this time, it's told by outsiders. Catalina, a history professor who would give only her first name, was a tough critic. "The movie is well-done. It has good intentions," she said. "But in my opinion, in the first part, the scenes in the jungle seemed a bit like a caricature." Though some debated the details of this story they know so well, most -- like a young Guevara lookalike who identified himself only as Daniel -- were pleased. "It has captured history to perfection," he said. "It has been well thought out and well-created." Others, like student Susel Paraza, were torn about seeing their history told by others. "What hurt me a little," she said, "is that it wasn't us, the Cubans, who thought to make a movie like this but instead a foreign director with foreign actors who have recreated this story very well." Other foreign actors have played Guevara, most notably Egyptian-born Omar Sharif in a 1969 U.S. production titled "Che!" Soderbergh's "Che" has been shown at six film festivals worldwide and will have a limited opening in the United States on December 12. It is scheduled for widespread U.S. distribution starting January 24. Although many may not know Guevara's history, his image is recognized worldwide from a photograph taken by Alberto Korda at a Havana memorial service in March 1960. Titled "Guerrillero Heroico" (Heroic Guerrilla), the image of a somber, long-haired and bearded Guevara wearing a beret with a lone star became what the Maryland Institute College of Art called "the most famous photograph in the world and a symbol of the 20th century." The image has been emblazoned on everything from T-shirts to posters and even tattoos. "There is no other image like it. What other image has been sustained in this way?" Trisha Ziff, the curator of an exhibition on the iconography of Guevara, asked in a 2007 interview with the BBC. "Che Guevara has become a brand. And the brand's logo is the image, which represents change. It has becomes the icon of the outside thinker, at whatever level -- whether it is anti-war, pro-green or anti-globalization." Guevara was 31 years old when the photo was taken. He has been dead for 41 years, longer than he was alive. Jonathan Green, former longtime director of the UCR/California Museum of Photography, has been quoted as saying, "Korda's image has worked its way into languages around the world. It has become an alpha-numeric symbol, a hieroglyph, an instant symbol. It mysteriously reappears whenever there's a conflict. There isn't anything else in history that serves in this way." CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report.

Summary A: The biopic "Che," starring Benicio Del Toro as Argentinean revolutionary Che Guevara, received acclaim when it was screened in Cuba as part of the 30th International Festival of the New Latin American Cinema. Del Toro, who won a best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival for his role, expressed anxiety about the film's reception in Cuba due to its historical significance. However, the film was well-received, with the state newspaper Granma praising Del Toro's portrayal of Guevara. The film, directed by Steven Soderbergh, is split into two parts, detailing Guevara's role in the Cuban revolution and his efforts in Africa and Bolivia.

Summary B: The biopic 'Che', starring Benicio Del Toro as Argentinean revolutionary Che Guevara, was screened at the 30th International Festival of the New Latin American Cinema in Cuba. The film, which details Guevara's role in the 1950s Cuban revolution, received acclaim from the audience. Del Toro won a best actor award for his role in the film at the Cannes Film Festival.

Article:
Editor's Note: Barry Eichengreen is George C. Pardee and Helen N. Pardee Professor of Economics and Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the author of "Golden Fetters: the Gold Standard and the Great Depression, 1919-1939." Barry Eichengreen says strong action should be taken to stop the financial crisis from getting worse. BERKELEY, California (CNN) -- Every time the economy and stock market turn down, financial historians get predictable calls from reporters. Could this be the start of another Great Depression? Could "it" possibly happen again? My stock answer has always been no. The Great Depression resulted from a series of economic and financial shocks -- the end of a housing bubble in 1926 and the end of a high-tech bubble in 1929 -- but also from truly breathtaking neglect and incompetence on the part of policymakers. It couldn't happen again precisely because policymakers know this history. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is a student of the Great Depression. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson remembers the mistakes of Andrew Mellon, Herbert Hoover's treasury secretary. We can be confident, I always answered, that there will not be another Great Depression because policymakers have read financial histories like mine. At least that was my line until recently. Now I have stopped taking reporters' calls. The first thing that made the Great Depression great, of course, was the Fed's failure to act. It basically stood by as the banking system and the economy collapsed around it. This time, in contrast, the Fed can hardly be criticized for inaction. Not only has it cut rates, but it has rolled out one new unprecedented initiative after another. Unfortunately, it has reacted more than acted. First, it provided funds to the commercial banks. Then, it targeted broker-dealers. Now, it is desperately propping up the commercial paper market. All the while however, the problem has been infecting new parts of the financial system. One thing that restrained the Fed in the 1930s was the fear that rate cuts might cause capital to flee to other countries and the dollar to crash. The danger was that the same liquidity that the Fed poured in through the top of the bucket might just leak back out through these holes in the bottom. There was a solution: coordinated rate cuts here and in Europe. Unfortunately, central bankers couldn't agree on what was needed. The result was further instability. That central banks have learned this lesson of history and now see the need for coordinated action is at least one ground for hope. The problem is that they have already used their bullets. iReport.com: What lessons have your family passed down from the Great Depression? U.S. Treasury bill rates have essentially fallen to zero, and the Fed's policy interest rates are only slightly above that level. Central banks are out of ammunition. This is no longer a problem they can solve by themselves. What is needed now is Treasury action to address what has morphed into a global banking crisis. Between 1930 and 1933, not just the U.S. but also Europe and Latin America experienced rolling banking crises. When Austria took desperate measures to prop up its banking system, its banking crisis only shifted to Germany. When Germany did the same, the crisis spread to the United States. This was beggar-thy-neighbor policy at its worst. We have seen some disturbing evidence of the same in recent weeks, as when Ireland unilaterally guaranteed all bank deposits and thereby sucked funds out of the British banking system. G7 leaders, when they meet in Washington at the end of this week, need to explain exactly how they will address this aspect of the problem. They need to commit money to recapitalizing their banking systems -- now, and not next week. The U.K., which has just announced a $50 billion plan for bank recapitalization, has shown how this can be done in a matter of days. But a coordinated initiative will require the U.S. to put up a considerably larger sum. My recommendation would be to abandon the idea of reverse auctions for toxic assets and instead use the $700 billion of the recently passed rescue plan for bank recapitalization. Although the Great Depression started in 1929, it took until 1933 for American leaders to grasp this nettle and recapitalize the banks. We can't afford to wait for years this time around. A final thing that made the Great Depression such a catastrophe was that some of the worst shocks occurred right before the 1932 presidential election. There then followed an extended interregnum between the election and inauguration of the new president when no one was in charge. The outgoing president, Hoover, asked his successor designate, Franklin Roosevelt, to cooperate with him on joint statements and policies, but FDR refused to do so. Meanwhile, the banking crisis deepened. Corporations failed. The economy was allowed to spiral downward. It was this disaster that led us to amend the constitution to shorten the time between presidential election and inauguration from 4 to 2½ months. The implication is clear. The two presidential candidates should be assembling their financial SWAT teams now. Paulson should promise that they will be invited into his office on November 5. This problem cannot wait until Inauguration Day. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.

Summary A: Economics professor Barry Eichengreen calls for strong action to mitigate the escalating financial crisis, criticizing the Federal Reserve's reactive approach. He emphasizes the need for Treasury intervention to tackle the global banking crisis and urges G7 leaders to commit funds for immediate bank recapitalization.

Summary B: Economist Barry Eichengreen warns that strong action is needed to prevent the financial crisis from worsening, drawing parallels with the Great Depression. He argues that while the Federal Reserve has been proactive, it has largely reacted rather than acted, and is now out of ammunition. Eichengreen recommends that the $700 billion from the recently passed rescue plan be used for bank recapitalization, and urges the presidential candidates to assemble their financial teams immediately, as the problem cannot wait until Inauguration Day.

Article:
LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Krishna Rajarman's classmates and friends remembered him Tuesday as a mentor and scholar who preferred to go home on weekends to spend time with his younger brothers than party on campus. Krishna Rajarman,  a Fulbright Scholar and honors student, was a junior at UCLA. "We asked him, 'Why not stay a weekend because we might do something fun?' " said Ashwin Bhongir, Krishna's roommate and childhood friend. "He said, 'I want to be here for my brothers. I like to spend time with my brothers, it's important.'" Krishna, a 19-year-old junior at UCLA, a Fulbright Scholar and an honors student, was found Monday fatally shot at his parents' home in suburban Los Angeles. Police said his father  killed the teen, his two younger brothers, ages 7 and 12, his grandmother and mother. Karthik Rajaram, a 45-year-old unemployed financial services expert, then killed himself, police said. The six bodies were discovered in their neatly tended home in an upscale suburb 20 minutes outside Los Angeles on Monday. A neighbor called police to report that the wife had failed to pick her up to take her to her job. Inside the house, police also found letters from the father explaining that mounting financial pressure had led him to kill. Fraternity member Vim Mahadev remembered Krishna as a devoted L.A. Lakers fan who occasionally mentioned family problems, but nothing unusual. "Nothing ever came up serious," said Mahadev. "It was mostly his dad, about financial problems. But most of the time it was how he was his hero because he was intelligent and he always knew the right decisions to make. "It's just so ironic." Krishna's friends Bhongir and Nahel Patel grew up around the Rajaram family and told CNN they never saw signs of family turmoil during their teenage years.   "I knew his family very well, and every time I went there, it was one of the most welcoming homes I've ever been to," said Bhongir. "It was always a fun loving place to be."   "He was one of the most promising friends that I ever knew, he was literally the smartest person I've ever known," said Bhongir. "He was going to make it." Bhongir and Nahel, both business economic majors at UCLA, said Krishna's father was a role model to them. Krishna had wanted to follow his father's footsteps in studies and career. The father received his MBA from UCLA in 1987, according to UCLA spokesman Phil Hampton. Police said he went on to work in a financial holding company and for major accounting firms, such as Price Waterhouse. As a freshman, Krishna joined the campus co-ed fraternity Delta Phi Beta, organized by South Asian students. Fraternity member Natasha Parikh said she was one of Krishna's closest friends.  "I just talked to him on Wednesday, and he was so excited about the new recruits we were having," she said. "He was so excited about this year, and it's so painful that he can't be here to experience the rest of our time at UCLA." "He really didn't talk about his personal life; I always saw him as a happy guy who never once said he was going through any major difficulty, so this has come as a complete shock."

Summary A: Krishna Rajarman, a 19-year-old Fulbright Scholar and honors student at UCLA, was found fatally shot at his parents' home in Los Angeles. His father, Karthik Rajaram, also killed Krishna's two younger brothers, grandmother, mother, and then himself due to financial stress. Krishna's friends, Ashwin Bhongir and Nahel Patel, who knew the Rajaram family well, expressed shock and remembered Krishna as a mentor and scholar.

Summary B: Krishna Rajarman, a 19-year-old Fulbright Scholar and honors student at UCLA, was found fatally shot at his parents' home in Los Angeles, along with his two younger brothers, grandmother, and mother. The police reported that his father, Karthik Rajaram, a 45-year-old unemployed financial services expert, killed the family due to mounting financial pressure before taking his own life. Friends and classmates remembered Krishna as a mentor, scholar, and devoted family member, expressing shock at the tragedy as they had seen no signs of family turmoil.

(CNN) -- Paul Harvey, the legendary radio host whose career sharing "the rest of the story" with listeners spanned more than 70 years, has died, according to ABC Radio Networks. Paul Harvey received the Medal of Freedom from President Bush in 2005. He was 90. Harvey died at a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, where he kept a winter home, said Louis Adams, a spokesman for the networks. He was surrounded by family members when he died, Adams said.  Known for his deliberate delivery and pregnant pauses, Harvey's broadcasts were heard on more than 1,200 radio stations and 400 Armed Forces networks and his commentaries appeared in 300 newspapers, according to his Web site. iReport.com: Share your memories of Paul Harvey . He had been hosting his radio shows part-time for much of the past year, after recovering from physical ailments including pneumonia and the death of his wife, Lynne "Angel" Harvey, in May 2008. "My father and mother created from thin air what one day became radio and television news," said Harvey's son, Paul Harvey Jr., in a written statement. "So, in the past year, an industry has lost its godparents and today millions have lost a friend." Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Harvey began his radio career in 1933 at KVOO-AM there while he was still in high school, his Web site says. He helped clean the station and was eventually was allowed to fill in on air, reading news and commercials.  Watch how Paul Harvey Aurandt got into broadcasting » . "Paul Harvey was one of the most gifted and beloved broadcasters in our nation's history," ABC Radio Networks President Jim Robinson said in a written statement. "As he delivered the news each day with his own unique style and commentary, his voice became a trusted friend in American households." Some critics faulted Harvey for the way he seamlessly intertwined news stories with advertisements, which he often read in his own voice in the middle of a story. But his accolades were plentiful -- from his 1990 induction into the National Radio Hall of Fame to receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from then-President George W. Bush in 2005. "Paul was a friendly and familiar voice in the lives of millions of Americans," Bush said Saturday in a written statement. "His commentary entertained, enlightened, and informed. Laura and I are pleased to have known this fine man, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family." The cause of Harvey's death was not immediately known. He was forced off the air temporarily in 2001 because of a virus that weakened a vocal cord. CNN's Doug Gross contributed to this report.

Summary A: Paul Harvey, the legendary radio host who spent over 70 years on air, has passed away at 90. ABC Radio Networks confirmed his death. Harvey, who was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Bush in 2005, was known for his unique delivery style and 'the rest of the story' segments.

Summary B: Legendary radio host Paul Harvey, known for his unique delivery and commentary, has died at the age of 90.

Article:
(CNN) -- Best-selling author and director Sebastian Junger says experiencing the existence of U.S. troops' experience in Afghanistan was like being "on Mars." Junger documented the reality of an Army platoon as its soldiers lived, fought and died at one of the most dangerous postings in the U.S. military, a 15-man outpost called Restrepo in Afghanistan's Korengal Valley. It's the focus of Junger's new feature-length documentary, also named "Restrepo." The outpost, Junger told CNN's Campbell Brown in an interview Thursday night, was hellish. "The first time I was up there we were attacked four times in one day. No running water, they didn't bathe for a month at a time. No internet, no phone, no electricity at first," he said. Junger said that after a few weeks at their base in Italy, the platoon's members just wanted to get back to Restrepo. "What was going on up there was brotherhood, very different from friendship. Brotherhood, you don't even have to like the guy, but if he's your brother, you'll protect him, you'll die for him. They all felt that way." While "Restrepo" is not a political film, Junger does believe NATO troops are making progress in Afghanistan, with violence in the country at a 30-year-low. "Sixteen thousand Afghan civilians have died because of NATO combat operations in Afghanistan since 2001 -- a horrifying number, but it pales comparison to the civilian deaths in the '90s. Four hundred thousand Afghan civilians died in the '90s... The question is, does the world have the staying power to see it through."

Summary A: Best-selling author and director Sebastian Junger has created a feature-length documentary, "Restrepo," which depicts the harsh realities of an Army platoon stationed at one of the most dangerous U.S. military outposts in Afghanistan's Korengal Valley. Junger describes the outpost as hellish, with constant attacks, no running water, internet, phone, or electricity, but notes that the soldiers formed a strong brotherhood. Despite the film not being political, Junger believes NATO troops are making progress in Afghanistan, citing a decrease in violence and civilian deaths compared to the 1990s.

Summary B: Sebastian Junger's documentary 'Restrepo' provides an intimate look at the life of an Army platoon stationed at a dangerous outpost in Afghanistan's Korengal Valley. The soldiers at Restrepo faced harsh conditions with no running water, internet, phone, or electricity. Despite these challenges, a strong sense of brotherhood developed among the soldiers, who were willing to protect and die for each other.

Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Searchers have found the flight data recorder from an Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed Monday with 90 people aboard, the Lebanese army said Thursday. The data recorder, commonly called a black box, was found at a depth of about 1,300 meters in the Mediterranean Sea. The recorder had not yet been retrieved, the army said. The Boeing 737-800, carrying eight crew members and 82 passengers, crashed into the sea after takeoff from Lebanon early Monday. At least 14 bodies had been recovered from the crash of the airliner, which was bound for the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, officials said. The plane crashed about 3.5 kilometers (2 miles) west of the town of Na'ameh, which is 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Beirut. Government-owned Ethiopian Airlines is one of the largest carriers in Africa, serving Europe and three other continents. CNN's Nada Husseini contributed to this report.

Summary A: The flight data recorder, or black box, from the Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed on Monday has been located in the Mediterranean Sea by searchers, according to the Lebanese army. The Boeing 737-800, which was carrying 90 people, crashed into the sea shortly after taking off from Lebanon.

Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigerian gunmen on Sunday released 12 sailors who ship was attacked two days earlier off the country's coast, a spokesman for the Nigerian military said. Pirates had boarded a German-flagged ship off the coast of Nigeria on Friday night and took the foreigners hostage, the country's military said. The attack took place about four nautical miles off Bonny Island, said Lt. Col. Timothy Antigha of the military Joint Task Force (JTF) in the Niger Delta. He didn't release any details on the pirates, only saying they are "criminals." One sailor was wounded in the attack and left on the boat, he said. The kidnappers later abandoned the ship and it was retrieved by the Nigerian navy. The freed sailors were on their way to Bonny Island, where their ship is currently anchored off the coast of the southern Nigerian state of Rivers. Earlier, Antigha had said he did not know the nationalities of the abducted sailors or whether the pirates had demanded a ransom.

Summary A: Nigerian gunmen released 12 sailors who were taken hostage after their German-flagged ship was attacked off the coast of Nigeria, near Bonny Island. The information was confirmed by Lt. Col. Timothy Antigha of the military Joint Task Force (JTF) in the Niger Delta. The freed sailors are now on their way to Bonny Island, in the southern Nigerian state of Rivers.

Summary B: Twelve sailors, who were taken hostage by pirates off the coast of Nigeria, have been released, according to a Nigerian military spokesperson. The pirates, described as "criminals", had boarded a German-flagged ship near Bonny Island, leaving one sailor wounded, before abandoning the ship which was later retrieved by the Nigerian navy.

Article:
Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand has revoked the visa of a Russian pianist accused of raping a 14-year-old boy, an immigration official said Thursday. Thailand's immigration bureau revoked the visa of Mikhail Pletnev because it believes he poses threats to the country, according to Maj. Gen. Pansak Kasemsan. The development means that even if the charges against Pletnev are eventually dropped, he will be deported from the country. Although the revocation of the visa is already in place, an exception allows him to enter the country while his case is pending. Pletnev was arrested and charged July 6 with raping the teenage boy in the Thai beach town of Pattaya, where he owns a house. The crime carries a maximum prison term of 20 years. The judge released him on a $9,000 bail until the criminal charges against him are resolved, with the provision that he return to the seaside town of Pattaya every 12 days to renew the conditions of the bail. That means Pletnev can travel abroad as long as he continues to make his court dates. Pletnev was in Thailand on Monday and is due back in the country on July 30. His attorney said he left the country Wednesday to see his mother for her 89th birthday. Thailand remains a destination for child migrants, many of whom enter the sex tourism industry, according to the Child Protection and Development Center. "Pattaya in particular has developed an international reputation for child sex tourism," the nongovernmental organization says on its website about the town two hours south of Bangkok. "Anti-trafficking researchers targeting street children estimate that Pattaya hosts about 1,500 to 2,000 homeless and impoverished children per year, while numbers are increasing. Children search for work, migrating -- alone or with their families -- from Thailand's northeast provinces, Cambodia, Burma, Laos and Vietnam." CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.

Summary A: Thailand has revoked the visa of Russian pianist Mikhail Pletnev, who is accused of raping a 14-year-old boy, due to perceived threats to the country. Pletnev, who was arrested and charged on July 6, will be deported even if the charges are dropped, but can enter the country while his case is pending. Pattaya, where the alleged crime took place, is known for child sex tourism, with an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 homeless and impoverished children per year.

Summary B: Russian pianist Mikhail Pletnev, accused of raping a 14-year-old boy in Pattaya, Thailand, faces a maximum prison term of 20 years. His visa has been revoked, but he is allowed to enter the country while his case is pending. He was released on a $9,000 bail with conditions to return to Pattaya every 12 days. The Child Protection and Development Center has identified Pattaya as a hotspot for child sex tourism.

Article:
(CNN) -- Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed said Saturday he will give in to a rebel demand that he impose Islamic law, or sharia, in an effort to halt fighting between Somali forces and Islamic insurgents. President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed  says sharia law in Somalia will not be strict. However, Ahmed told a news conference he won't agree to a strict interpretation of the law, which forbids girls from attending school, requires veils for women and beards for men, and bans music and television. The president, speaking at his palace in the capital, Mogadishu, said local elders and religious leaders, acting as liaisons with the militants, brought him a message saying the rebels wanted a truce in the two-year-old fighting. He also asked African peacekeepers to stand down. Ahmed, who was elected January 31, said he would ask the AU contingent to leave once there is a solid political solution to the conflict. More than 40,000 Somalis have returned to abandoned neighborhoods in Mogadishu over the past six weeks, despite some of the heaviest fighting in months, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Friday. They are part of the more than a million residents who have been displaced by fighting in Somalia, including 100,000 who fled to neighboring countries last year alone, according to the United Nations. Ethiopian troops entered the country at its request in December 2006. The Ethiopians ousted the Islamic Courts Union, an Islamic movement that had claimed control of Mogadishu earlier that year. Ethiopia's action had the blessing of the United States, which accused the Islamic Courts Union of harboring fugitives from al Qaeda. But various Islamist groups -- including al-Shabab, which the United States has designated a terror organization -- rejected the presence of Ethiopian forces and mounted an insurgent campaign against the Ethiopians and the transitional government. From Mohamed Amiin Adow for CNN .

Summary A: Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed has agreed to impose Islamic law, or sharia, in Somalia to halt the fighting with Islamic insurgents. He received this request from local elders and religious leaders acting as liaisons with the militants. Ahmed also asked African peacekeepers to stand down and stated that he would request the AU contingent to leave once a solid political solution to the conflict is found. He clarified that the interpretation of the law will not be strict.

Summary B: Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed has agreed to impose Islamic law, or sharia, in response to a demand from rebels, in an attempt to end ongoing conflict with Islamic insurgents. However, he clarified that he will not enforce a strict interpretation of the law, which includes prohibitions on girls attending school and bans on music and television. Ahmed, who was elected in January, also requested African peacekeepers to stand down and said he would ask them to leave once a political solution to the conflict is found. Despite heavy fighting, over 40,000 Somalis have returned to Mogadishu in the past six weeks, part of over a million residents displaced by the conflict.

Article:
ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Are you one of the seemingly few Americans in the market for a car? There are more of you out there than you might think. Clark Howard: Before jumping at all the new car deals, think about the bigger picture of car ownership costs. CNW Marketing Research, a respected automotive marketing research firm, reports that 4 million used cars were purchased in the United States during the month of May alone. That's amazing when you consider that the market for new cars is 9 million in the United States over the course of an entire 12 months. Yet don't overlook the new car as a potential purchase just yet. New data from Comerica Bank's Auto Affordability Index shows that new cars are now the most affordable they've been since records started being kept in 1979. In fact, the average new car is now $1,700 cheaper than it was during the last quarter of 2008. And we've got more price cuts coming because of oversupply. As you probably know, I'm a used car guy, the self-proclaimed champion of driving a car until the wheels fall off. So I can't believe the advice that I am about to give ... but it's now possible to get a better deal on a brand new car than on a relatively new used car. Watch Clark Howard talk to a woman who learned what not to do when buying a used car » . It's really just a classic case of supply and demand. The used car market is up about 23 percent, and new car sales are down 34 percent, according to CNW. More new cars on dealer lots mean more deals for you. But realize this: It's just a temporary phenomenon. Do not take this blip on the radar as gospel for the future; in most instances, a used car will almost always be a better buy. Just not right now. When buying a new vehicle, you want to start by arranging your financing first. Go to your bank or credit union and prequalify for a car loan or apply online. This will tell you how much car you can afford and what type of monthly payment you will have to budget. Next, you want to get a price for the car you have in mind. In the past, I've talked about using CarsDirect.com to get a guaranteed quote. A car dealer then can do his or her best to beat that online quote and win your business. In some cases, the price from CarsDirect.com winds up being the best a consumer can get. But now there's a new kid on the block known as Zag.com. This service gives buyers instant guaranteed upfront prices from a network of certified dealers. It also offers an easy delivery process that helps you avoid "the grind" at a dealership. Do you know what "the grind" is? That's when you're at a dealer lot, and the sales representative says he or she will go talk to the manager about getting you the best deal. Instead they go watch TV for five minutes, and then come back and tell you that the manager couldn't help out with a good price -- despite their best efforts on your behalf. That's why sites such as Zag and CarsDirect are so appealing; they take you out of the car dealers' ballpark and put you on level playing ground. But before you jump at all the new car deals, take a moment to think about the bigger picture of car ownership costs. It's more than just the sticker price and the expense of gas. AAA reports that the true annual cost of owning and operating a car is $9,369. Ouch. That $9,369 takes into account somewhat hidden costs such as insurance, maintenance, interest on a car note, depreciation and other factors. Hey, maybe driving your current car until the wheels fall off is still a great idea.

Summary A: New data from Comerica Bank's Auto Affordability Index shows that new cars are now the most affordable they've been since 1979, making it possible to get a better deal on a new car than on a used one. This is due to an oversupply of new cars and a 23% increase in the used car market. However, potential buyers are advised to consider the overall cost of car ownership, which AAA reports to be $9,369 annually, including insurance, maintenance, interest, depreciation, and other factors.

Summary B: Clark Howard, citing CNW Marketing Research and Comerica Bank's Auto Affordability Index, suggests that new cars may be a better deal than used ones due to an oversupply. He recommends using CarsDirect.com or the new service Zag.com to get guaranteed quotes that car dealers can try to beat. However, he also warns buyers to consider the total cost of car ownership, as AAA reports the annual cost to be $9,369, including insurance, maintenance, and depreciation.

Article:
ROCKWOOD, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Four generations of Saylors have worked the family's dairy farm for nearly a century, but for the past three years, the cows have been doing something besides providing milk: They've been helping power the place. "The farm used to get a lot of complaints," says farmer Shawn Saylor. "It used to stink a lot." Growing up on the sprawling spread 90 minutes from Pittsburgh, 36-year-old farmer Shawn Saylor developed into a self-described science buff. So it was no surprise that, when faced with rising energy costs, Saylor turned to technology. He tapped into an abundant and easily accessible energy source: manure from about 600 cows.  Watch how cow poo powers the farm » . "It's a pretty simple process. There's not really a lot to it," Saylor said. "Manure comes from the cows, and there's energy left in the manure." The process is known as anaerobic digestion, and here's how it works: . With the help of a mechanical scraper in the barn, manure drops into a 19,000-gallon tank. The slurry then moves into the digester, which is 16 feet deep and 70 feet in diameter. It's heated there for about 16 days while the bacteria break down the organic matter in order to produce methane gas. That gas is burned in two engine generators to make electricity.  See an interactive explaining the process » . Heat created by the generators keeps the digester hot, heats the buildings around the farm and helps provide hot water. The electricity is used to power this farm and a dozen neighboring homes, Saylor said. And there's still some left over, which he sells back to the grid. Overall, the poo power helps Saylor's bottom line. "In savings, there's $200,000 a year, in either extra income from sale of electricity or cost offsets," he said. "So you're talking about system project costs of over a million dollars to build the system but a payback of five years or less." Before he installed the system, the pungent smell from the cows could linger for three to four days, Saylor said. "The farm used to get a lot of complaints from motorists, which is understandable. It used to stink a lot." Now, the digesters reduce 98 percent of all odor, although he admits that if the wind blows, you still "get a whiff." The farm's leftover solid waste is sold to the community. "We use it for bedding for the animals," according to Saylor. "A lot of people like to get it for their gardens ... because it doesn't smell much." Farm-based digesters became popular in the United States during the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s. But the technology didn't catch on, possibly because of the high operational costs and declining energy prices, according to the Department of Agriculture. Although Saylor had been interested in digesters for years, his dream didn't become reality until 2006. That's when he received a $600,000 grant from Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection. But Saylor's work isn't done. He intends to make his farm entirely self-sufficient by using waste vegetable oil to make biodiesel fuel. He said his goal is to waste nothing. "In a biodiesel system, all the waste products can either be used or fed back into the digester to make more gas," he said. "I've always looked at new technologies and believed you kind of have to work with that stuff to stay with the future."

Summary A: Shawn Saylor, a farmer from Pennsylvania, has been using manure from his 600 cows to generate electricity for his farm and a dozen neighboring homes through a process called anaerobic digestion. The system, which cost over a million dollars to build but saves $200,000 a year in energy costs, reduces 98% of the farm's odor, and Saylor plans to make his farm entirely self-sufficient by using waste vegetable oil to make biodiesel fuel.

Summary B: Shawn Saylor, a farmer from Pennsylvania, has been using cow manure from his dairy farm to generate electricity through a process known as anaerobic digestion, saving him $200,000 a year in energy costs. The process, which was popularized in the United States during the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s according to the Department of Agriculture, involves the breakdown of organic matter in the manure to produce methane gas, which is then used to generate electricity. In addition to the financial benefits, the process also reduces the odor from the farm by 98%. Saylor's project was made possible through a $600,000 grant from Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection.

Article:
(CNN) -- Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney addressed the  Republican National Convention on Wednesday. Here is the text of that speech: . Former Gov. Mitt Romney says Sen. John McCain will rein in government spending. Romney: Thank you. Thank you so very much. Ann and I love you all. We have a deep feeling in our hearts for you. We respect you for the values you have and the vision we have for America together. Thank you so much, our dear friends. We sure love you. Thank you. You know, for decades now, the Washington sun has been rising in the east. You see, Washington has been looking to the eastern elites, to the editorial pages of the Times and the Post, and to the broadcasters from the -- from the coast. Yes.  Watch Romney's entire speech » . If America really wants to change, it's time to look for the sun in the west, because it's about to rise and shine from Arizona and Alaska. Last week, the Democratic convention talked about change. But what do you think? Is Washington now, liberal or conservative? Let me ask you some questions. Is a Supreme Court decision liberal or conservative that awards Guantanamo terrorists with constitutional rights? It's liberal. Is a government liberal or conservative that puts the interests of the teachers union ahead of the needs of our children? It's liberal. Is a Congress liberal or conservative that stops nuclear power plants and off-shore drilling, making us more and more dependent on Middle Eastern tyrants? It's liberal. Is government spending, putting aside inflation, liberal or conservative if it doubles since 1980? It's liberal. We need change all right: change from a liberal Washington to a conservative Washington. We have a prescription for every American who wants change in Washington: Throw out the big-government liberals and elect John McCain and Sarah Palin. It's the same prescription for a stronger economy. I spent 25 years in the private sector. I've done business in many foreign countries. I know why jobs come and why they go away. And I know that liberals don't have a clue. They think that we have the biggest and strongest economy in the world because of our government. They're wrong. America is strong because of the ingenuity, and entrepreneurship, and hard work of the American people. The American people have always been the source of our nation's strength, and they always will be. We strengthen our people and our economy when we preserve and promote opportunity. Opportunity is what lets hope become reality. Opportunity expands when there's excellence and choice in education, when taxes are lowered, when every citizen has affordable, portable health insurance, and when constitutional freedoms are preserved. Opportunity rises when children are raised in homes and schools that are free from pornography, and promiscuity, and drugs, where there are homes that are blessed with family values and the presence of a mom and a dad. America -- America cannot long lead the family of nations if we fail the family here at home. You see, liberals would replace opportunity with dependency on government largesse. They grow government and raise taxes to put more people on Medicaid, to take work requirements out of welfare, and to grow the ranks of those who pay no taxes at all. Dependency is death to initiative, to risk-taking and opportunity. It's time to stop the spread of government dependency and fight it like the poison it is. You know, it's time for the party of big ideas, not the party of Big Brother. Our economy is under attack. China is acting like Adam Smith on steroids, buying oil from the world's worst and selling nuclear technology. Russia and the oil states are siphoning more than $500 billion a year from us in what could become the greatest transfer of economic wealth in the history of the world. This is no time for timid, liberal, empty gestures. Our economy has slowed down this year, and a lot of people are hurting. What happened? Mortgage money was handed out like candy, and speculators bought homes for free. And when this mortgage mania finally broke, it slammed the economy. And stratospheric gas prices made things even worse. Democrats want to use the slowdown as an excuse to do what their special interests are always begging for: higher taxes, bigger government, and less trade with other nations. It's the same path Europe took a few decades ago. It leads to moribund growth and double-digit unemployment. The right course is the one championed by Ronald Reagan 30 years ago and by John McCain and Sarah Palin today. The right course is to rein in government spending, lower taxes, take a Weedwacker to excessive regulation and mandates, put a stop to tort windfalls, and to stand up to the Tyrannosaurus appetite of government unions. The right course -- the right course is to pursue every source of energy security, from new efficiencies to renewables, from coal to non-CO2 producing nuclear, and for the immediate drilling for more oil off our shores. And I have -- I have one more recommendation for energy conservation: Let's keep Al Gore's private jet on the ground. Last week, last week, did you hear any Democrats talk about the threat from radical, violent jihad? No. You see, Republicans believe that there is good and evil in the world. Ronald Reagan called out the evil empire. George Bush labeled the terror-sponsor states exactly what they are: The axis of evil. And at Saddleback, after Barack Obama dodged and ducked every direct question, John McCain hit the nail on the head: Radical, violent Islam is evil, and he will defeat it. This party... You're hearing it here. You're hearing it here, and they're hearing it across the country. You see, in this party, in this room tonight, and all over America, people in our party prefer straight talk to politically correct talk. Republicans, led by John McCain and Sarah Palin, will fight to preserve the values that have preserved the nation. We'll strengthen our economy and keep us from being held hostage by Putin, Chavez, and Ahmadinejad. And we will never allow America to retreat in the face of evil extremism. Just like you, just like you, there's never been a day when I was not proud to be an American. We -- we Americans inherited the greatest nation in the history of the Earth. It's our burden and our privilege to preserve it, to renew its spirit so that its noble past is prologue to its glorious future. To this we're all dedicated. And I firmly believe, by the providence of the almighty, that we will succeed. President McCain and Vice President Palin will keep America as it has always been: The hope of the Earth. Thank you, and God bless America.

Summary A: Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney addressed the Republican National Convention, endorsing Senator John McCain and Sarah Palin, and criticizing liberal policies. Romney argued that the U.S. economy is strong due to the ingenuity and hard work of the American people, not the government. He criticized liberal policies for promoting dependency on government, and called for a change from a liberal Washington to a conservative one. Romney also emphasized the need to rein in government spending, lower taxes, and increase energy security.

Summary B: Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, in his speech at the Republican National Convention, endorsed John McCain and Sarah Palin, advocating for a conservative change in Washington. He criticized liberal policies, arguing they lead to dependency on government and hinder economic growth. Romney emphasized the need to rein in government spending, promote opportunity, and pursue energy security. He also highlighted the threat of radical, violent jihad and the need to confront it.

Editor's note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. Begala is not a paid political consultant for any politicians or candidates.  Click here for a rival view . Paul Begala says McCain's VP choice,  Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, is completely unqualified to be president. (CNN) -- John McCain needs what Kinky Friedman calls "a checkup from the neck up." In choosing Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be his running mate, he is not thinking "outside the box," as some have said. More like out of his mind. Palin a first-term governor of a state with more reindeer than people, will have to put on a few pounds just to be a lightweight. Her personal story is impressive: former fisherman, mother of five. But that hardly qualifies her to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. For a man who is 72 years old and has had four bouts with cancer to have chosen someone so completely unqualified to become president is shockingly irresponsible. Suddenly, McCain's age and health become central issues in the campaign, as does his judgment. In choosing this featherweight, McCain passed over Tom Ridge, a decorated combat hero, a Cabinet secretary and the former two-term governor of the large, complex state of Pennsylvania. iReport.com: 'McCain pick might be a gimmick' He passed over Mitt Romney, who ran a big state, Massachusetts; a big company, Bain Capital; and a big event, the Olympics. He passed over Kay Bailey Hutchison, the Texas senator who is knowledgeable about the military, good on television and -- obviously -- a woman. He passed over Joe Lieberman, his best friend in the Senate and fellow Iraq Kool-Aid drinker. He passed over former congressman, trade negotiator and budget director Rob Portman. And he also passed over Mike Huckabee, the governor of Arkansas. For months, the McCainiacs have said they will run on his judgment and experience. In his first presidential decision, John McCain has shown that he is willing to endanger his country, potentially leaving it in the hands of someone who simply has no business being a heartbeat away from the most powerful, complicated, difficult job in human history. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.

Summary A: Democratic strategist Paul Begala criticizes John McCain's choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, arguing that she is unqualified to be president. Begala suggests that McCain needs a 'checkup from the neck up', a phrase borrowed from Kinky Friedman. He also notes that McCain passed over other potential running mates such as Tom Ridge, a decorated combat hero and former governor of Pennsylvania, and Mitt Romney, former governor of Massachusetts and head of Bain Capital.

Summary B: Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor, Paul Begala, criticizes John McCain's choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, calling her unqualified for the presidency. Begala argues that McCain's decision is irresponsible given his age and health, and it brings his judgment into question. He points out that McCain overlooked other potential running mates with more experience and qualifications, such as Tom Ridge, Mitt Romney, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Joe Lieberman, Rob Portman, and Mike Huckabee. Begala concludes that McCain's first presidential decision shows a willingness to endanger the country by potentially leaving it in the hands of someone unfit for the presidency.

Article:
(CNN) -- When Bridget and Scott Bear were expecting their first child, they wanted to know what it would cost so they could set aside enough money in their health savings account. Knowing in advance what the price tag would be for the birth of their son gave the Bears "peace of mind." The Omaha, Nebraska, couple went to Alegent Health's Web site and found the My Cost function, entered their insurance information and learned the hospital charges would be around $2,500, Bridget Bear said. When Bridget Bear gave birth to their son, Lawson, on April 2 at Lakeside Hospital -- a healthy 8-pound, 8-ounce baby -- the couple were ready for the bill, she said. Alegent is one of a growing number of hospitals, Web sites, even states, helping patients comparison shop on the Internet before undergoing a medical procedure or test. Hospitals say they're responding to a growing demand from patients who are paying for more of their health care out of pocket, thanks to rising deductibles and the advent of high deductible, consumer-driven plans like the Bears have. In the early 2000s, Bellin Health System in Green Bay, Wisconsin, began receiving more calls from patients wanting to know what a particular procedure would cost, said Jeff Hampton, director of revenue cycle management. "As sad as it sounds, we had to say we didn't know," Hampton said. That's because something like knee replacement isn't one expense but many. There are the surgeon's fee, the operating room charge, equipment and supplies, the hospital bed during recovery, and other costs. Five years ago, Bellin put the information together so would-be patients could get an accurate picture of the final bill. On its Compare Care Line, a Bellin financial adviser provides an average cost from the previous six months for a given procedure and the price range over that time period. "People are shopping around more," Hampton said. "If consumers want to know what the cost of something is going to be, we should be able to give them an answer." Alegent, with nine hospitals in Nebraska and southwest Iowa, started My Cost in January 2007, posting the price of more than 500 tests and procedures along with data on quality of care. Integris Health, a 14-hospital system in Oklahoma City, has a Consumer Price Line number that allows patients to learn what the out-of-pocket costs will be for their procedures. The service started in July 2007 after CEO Stanley Hupfeld had some "secret shoppers" try to get pricing information, said Nicole White, Integris spokesperson. Consumer Price Line receives between 800 and 1,000 calls a month, she said. Sixteen state hospital associations operate Web sites that allow comparison shopping for such inpatient procedures as appendectomies, maternity stays and knee or hip replacements: Georgia, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin. Other states have their own systems. Minnesota health care providers collaborated on the HealthScores Web site, which allows price comparisons between 110 providers for 103 common medical procedures. The Web site tells what insurance companies pay, on average, for procedures ranging from Caesarean delivery to a colonoscopy. Pennsylvania has detailed price information on cardiac and joint replacement surgeries on its Health Care Cost Containment Council Web site, but the data are several years old. Still, it underscores the enormous differences in prices. For example, knee replacement costs ranged from $11,243 to $97,031 at the state's hospitals. Even individual hopsitals are striving to offer more transparency. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, posts very detailed information about prices on the hospital's Web site. Spokesperson Jason Aldous said it's part of the medical center's mission to provide transparency about cost, outcomes and patient satisfaction. The information is only a starting point, though, Aldous said. "We want that to drive you to a more informed conversation" with a doctor, he said. "A bilateral knee replacement is not like buying a car on the lot." But Brad Myers, co-founder of New Choice Health, said health care and car buying are a lot more similar than many people think. The eight-month-old site was created to do for health care what automobile pricing guides did for new car buying 20 years ago, Myers said. New Choice Health, which does not charge for its service, lists the average cost insurance companies pay for 400 different procedures at different facilities across the country. Want to know the cost of a colonoscopy in Cleveland? New Choice Health gives you more than 50 facilities, with prices ranging from $550 to $1,200. How about a PET scan in Portland? The site offers more than 20 facilities with a price range of $1,600 to $2,100. The site is designed for people who are uninsured, individually insured or with a high deductible plan, Myers said. Patients who are not covered in a group plan generally get bills three times as high, he said. He advocates bargaining. "Just picking up the phone will get you 20 percent off. Nine times out of 10, if you want to haggle, it's more like 50 percent off," Myers says. New Choice Health, which went live in January, now gets 40,000 to 50,000 users a month, Myers says. Paul Fronstin, a senior research associate with the Employee Benefit Research Institute, said cost sites such as New Choice Health are crude tools because they don't tell people with traditional plans what they'll pay out of pocket. A lot depends on how much of their deductible they've already spent. Also, people with expensive chronic diseases such as diabetes usually reach their deductible early in the year and are less concerned about price after that, Fronstin said. Childbirth is a perfect procedure to price ahead of time, according to Kathleen Stoll at Families USA. Others are not as clear cut. With knee surgery, for example, patients may not know the exact procedure they need or what complications could arise, she said. Bridget Bear said knowing what hospital fees would be in advance gave her and her husband peace of mind: "We were able to enjoy the anticipation of Lawson a little bit more instead of having to worry about the financial piece of it." CNN's Sabriya Rice contributed to this report.

Summary A: Bridget and Scott Bear, a couple from Omaha, Nebraska, used Alegent Health's My Cost function to estimate the cost of their first child's birth, which was around $2,500. Similarly, Bellin Health System in Green Bay, Wisconsin, has a Compare Care Line that provides an average cost from the previous six months for a given procedure and the price range over that time period. Integris Health, a 14-hospital system in Oklahoma City, also offers a Consumer Price Line that informs patients about the out-of-pocket costs for their procedures. These tools are part of a growing trend among hospitals to provide patients with cost estimates for medical procedures.

Summary B: A growing number of hospitals and websites are providing cost information for medical procedures and tests, allowing patients to comparison shop before undergoing treatment. This trend is in response to the increasing number of patients paying for their healthcare out of pocket due to rising deductibles and high deductible, consumer-driven plans. Some states also operate websites that allow for price comparisons for common procedures, and individual hospitals are striving to offer more transparency about costs.

Washington (CNN) -- Football player Albert Haynesworth has been charged with misdemeanor sexual abuse involving a waitress at a Washington hotel bar. A defensive tackle for the Washington Redskins, Haynesworth, 29, allegedly stuck a credit card down the front of a server's dress and fondled her breast, according to prosecutors. Court papers do not identify the waitress but say the incident happened around 2 a.m. on February 13 at a rooftop lounge atop the W Hotel. An indictment was returned Tuesday by a grand jury in Superior Court of the District of Columbia. An arraignment has been scheduled for May 10. According to a news release, Haynesworth could face up to 180 days in jail and a maximum fine of $1,000 if convicted. Haynesworth's defense attorney, A. Scott Bolden, called the indictment "disappointing, regretful and a difficult case for the government to prove." "The indictment is merely a charge, not a conviction," Bolden said. "And in fact, my client maintains his innocence because he is innocent. We will vigorously continue to fight these charges, and I fully expect him to be exonerated from any wrongdoing." Earlier this year, Haynesworth also was charged with assaulting a motorist after a traffic incident in Reston, Virginia.

Article:
Dabola, Guinea (CNN) -- Violence and voter intimidation in Guinea's eastern region has forced the displacement of thousands of ethnic Peul who support presidential candidate Cellou Dalein Diallo, according to an official for the Red Cross in Guinea and local officials of Diallo's party. The West African nation's long-awaited, much-delayed second round presidential runoff between Diallo and Alpha Conde is scheduled for Sunday. But more than a week of violence and intimidation that has forced thousands of people to leave their homes in the towns of Siguiri, Kouroussa and Kissidougou in eastern Guinea has soured what would be the nation's most credible democratic presidential vote in its 52-year history. Are you there? Share images and video with CNN iReport . Ananie Kashironge, head of media relations for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Conakry, the nation's capital, told CNN on Tuesday that 2,800 people were displaced on October 29 and 30 alone. In addition, commercial trucks filled with ethnic Peul and all their possessions have been leaving the eastern towns of Siguiri (about 800 kilometers from Conakry) and Kouroussa (about 580 kilometers from Conakry) every day for the past 12 days, and local officials for Diallo's UFDG party say a total of 15,000 to 20,000 Peul have been displaced around the country. Most of the displaced people have traveled west to the Fouta Djallon region, where they have relatives, the officials say. After a rally for Conde in Conakry on October 22 in which dozens of supporters fell sick after drinking contaminated water and yogurt, ethnic Malinke people attacked Peul in Upper Guinea, especially in Siguiri and Kouroussa, for days. Those displaced spoke of Malinke men looting and burning Peul-owned businesses and demolishing homes where Peul lived in Siguiri. Officials for Diallo's party said they registered the deaths of three Peul in Siguiri, one who had been fatally beaten and two who had died after being struck by stones. Conde, whose father is from the Malinke ethnic group, draws much of his support from the majority Malinke region of Upper Guinea, where most of the violence happened. Diallo, an ethnic Peul, has his base of supporters in the northwestern Fouta Djallon region. Sabo Camara, the campaign director for the UFDG party in Dabola, a town on the border of the Fouta Djallon and Upper Guinea regions where many Peul have stayed or passed through, said the violence seemed planned. "They don't want [the Peul] to vote and we heard that they even put out a communique on local radio saying that if [the Peul] stay there until election day they will kill all of them," Camara told CNN on Monday. "We estimate that 15 to 20,000 people have passed through or stayed in Dabola" since October 22," he added. "Many told us that meetings had been organized, and razors and knives distributed to get rid of the Peul by force." One displaced man said those who forced them out made no secret of the reason. "They told us, 'Come election day not a single Peul will vote here,' which is why they chased us away," said Thierno Barry, who left Siguiri with his family and all their belongings and was heading for his village of origin in the Fouta Djallon region. And a displaced Peul woman traveling from Siguiri who asked not to be named for safety reasons told a similar story. "They gave out a list of people from the Peul ethnic group and said that they have to leave before the election or they will be killed," she said. Camara said the authorities in Siguiri and Kouroussa, members of a military junta who has ruled Guinea since December, 2008, did not do anything to stop the violence. "We are under the impression that the authorities are complicit. Otherwise how can there be such trouble for four, five days without the authorities intervening," he said. Cheik Kaba, a Malinke businessman in Kankan, an upper Guinea city some 120 kilometers from Siguiri, told CNN that anti-Peul violence had spread to Kankan but had been contained because of local peace efforts. Conakry supporters of Conde's RPG party "called us to say that [the Peul] poisoned RPG members. ... Everyone wanted to destroy everything here, but we reasoned with them and made them understand that it is our country and Guinea belongs to everyone, so they left them alone," Kaba said. Dr. Mohamed Saliou Camara, professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida and author of a book on Guinea's independence leader, told CNN recently that "ethnicity becomes truly a problem when politicians resort to it to compensate for their lack of viable ideological platform and political program to meaningfully mobilize the electorate." The number of displaced people has once again complicated efforts to hold a credible second round of presidential elections. Siaka Toumani Sangare, the retired Malian general in charge of Guinea's electoral commission, told journalists at a press conference on Monday that the government was taking measures to ensure that those displaced will be able to vote. But with thousands of displaced people now in remote villages with electoral cards left behind in Siguiri and Kouroussa, it will be very difficult for the inefficient Guinean government to reach all those affected. "We are very scared because this is a dangerous precedent, a very dangerous precedent," Sabo Camara said. "If people who have lived in a place for 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, are told to leave the houses they have built, the businesses filled with their goods, it's really quite worrying."

Summary A: Violence and voter intimidation in Guinea's eastern region have displaced thousands of ethnic Peul, who support presidential candidate Cellou Dalein Diallo, ahead of the country's second round presidential runoff. The Red Cross and local officials report that between 15,000 to 20,000 Peul have been displaced, with many fleeing to the Fouta Djallon region. The violence, which includes looting, burning of businesses, and demolishing homes, is believed to be an attempt to prevent the Peul from voting in the upcoming election.

Summary B: In the lead up to Guinea's presidential runoff between Cellou Dalein Diallo and Alpha Conde, violence and voter intimidation have displaced thousands of ethnic Peul, Diallo's supporters, particularly from the eastern towns of Siguiri and Kouroussa. The International Committee of the Red Cross reported that 2,800 people were displaced in just two days. Conde, who garners significant support from the majority Malinke region of Upper Guinea, is a key figure in this conflict.

Article:
San Diego, California (CNN) -- Even though they were stuck without air conditioning, hot showers and decent meals, some of the passengers who made it off a crippled Carnival Cruise Lines ship said Friday that they would go on a cruise again. "I'm so thankful that we're all alive," Leticia Lewis said on CNN's "American Morning." "I don't wish this experience on anyone. It wasn't a wonderful event. But I would take another one." Amber Haslerud, another passenger, said her voyage on the ill-fated Carnival Cruise ship Splendor was her first cruise, and she would also go on another one. "I definitely would give it another go and try to get the experience I should have had this time," said Haslerud. "I deserve it after all that we went through this week." The ship and its approximately 3,300 passengers arrived in San Diego on Thursday, four days after a fire in the engine room left the ship without air conditioning, hot showers or refrigeration one day into a scheduled seven-day cruise along the Mexican coast. "It was absolutely deplorable," passenger Marquis Horace said. At one point, the ship ran out of food, he said, and "they started making mayo sandwiches." Passengers said they weren't told there was a fire until they left the ship. Horace said the crew informed passengers only of "a flameless fire." Carnival spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz said officials initially spoke only of smoke because the crew couldn't get into the engine room to assess the situation. Passengers were advised of the fire once it was confirmed, she said. Maritime law doesn't require cruise lines to tell passengers about onboard problems, said Robert Jarvis, a professor of law at Nova Southern University in Fort Lauderdale, Flordia. He said it sometimes makes sense to limit or delay the release of information to avoid a panic. Carnival's position is to inform passengers any time an issue will affect their cruise, de la Cruz said. The cruise line has said it plans to give customers who were aboard the Splendor a full refund, reimbursement for travel costs and a free cruise. Natalie Martinez and Angela Evans are among those who said they would also go on another cruise. But they said they would bring a survival kit with flashlights, chocolate and air freshener. And "I think we would wait a year," Martinez added.. Some passengers aren't sure if they'll cruise again. Maurice Harold and his wife, Cynthia Harold, not only had to endure being adrift, they had to do so without some of their own clothes, medicines and other items lost when their luggage went into the water while being loaded onto the ship. "It was pretty traumatic. It was a scary situation, said Cynthia Harold, who said she needs to use an oxygen machine while sleeping and was unable to after the ship lost power. "I really haven't slept since I left Virginia Beach," she said. The couple said they were unsure of their next steps, adding that it all depends on how Carnival compensates them. Others looked at the incident differently calling it an "adventure." "A lot of things went wrong, but it was really fun," said one young passenger, Ryan Harlan, who was traveling with his parents. "We went to the Kids' Camp." He said the Kids' Camp was, in fact, his favorite part, because he made some friends. And the worst part? "Being stranded in the middle of the ocean," he said. The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday it was investigating the incident. But later in the day the safety board said officials from Panama would lead the investigation because that is the country the vessel is flagged under. The U.S. Coast  Guard will also be part of the investigation, the transportation board said.

Summary A: After a fire in the engine room left the Carnival Cruise Lines ship Splendor stranded without basic amenities, the ship carrying approximately 3,300 passengers arrived in San Diego four days later. Despite the ordeal, some passengers expressed willingness to go on another cruise. Carnival plans to compensate customers with a full refund, reimbursement for travel costs, and a free cruise. Interestingly, maritime law does not require cruise lines to inform passengers about onboard problems.

Summary B: A fire in the engine room left the Carnival Cruise ship Splendor without air conditioning, hot showers, or refrigeration, stranding approximately 3,300 passengers for four days. Despite the ordeal, some passengers expressed willingness to go on another cruise, while others were unsure, and the cruise line plans to offer full refunds, travel cost reimbursements, and a free cruise to those affected.

Article:
(InStyle.com) -- Is there anything as romantic as a classic big screen kiss? Even today -- when most Hollywood movies don't exactly fade to black after the lovers lock lips -- the best kisses still have the power to send shivers down the spine. In honor of Valentine's Day, InStyle chose the most memorable cinematic embraces: upside down, on a boat, and in the pouring rain. "Gone with the Wind" "You need kissing badly," Clark Gable, as Rhett Butler, told Vivien Leigh's Scarlett O'Hara in this 1939 epic. "You should be kissed, and often. And by someone who knows how." Later on, while proposing to the twice-widowed Scarlett, he proves he's the man for the job. See all 25 iconic movie kisses . "Lady and the Tramp" She was the original uptown girl; he was a lovable drifter. But when these two crazy pups came together over a very long piece of spaghetti in this 1955 animated film, it was forever. "Breakfast at Tiffany's" Truman Capote's original 1958 novella wasn't exactly a love story, so the author was less than thrilled with the 1961 big screen adaptation. (For one thing, he'd wanted Marilyn Monroe to play Holly Golightly.) But audiences adored this stylish film, particularly for the final scene, in which Holly (Audrey Hepburn) and Paul (George Peppard) make a rainy New York City alley seem as romantic as any pink-streaked sunset. InStyle.com: The most stylish celebrity couples . "When Harry Met Sally" This 1989 comedy made numerous witty contributions to the romantic lexicon -- and kickstarted a (still-raging) debate as to whether men and women could "really" be friends -- but it was the pair's New Year's Eve reconciliation that moved viewers to tears. As Billy Crystal (Harry) told Meg Ryan (Sally): "I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with someone, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible." "Pretty Woman" "I don't kiss on the mouth," Vivian (Julia Roberts) warns Edward (Richard Gere) at the beginning of this 1990 movie. So when she does, it's pivotal -- the audience understands that she's come to regard Edward as much more than a client. But even that kiss can't beat the one at the happy ending, after Edward "rescues" Vivian on her fire escape and she promises to "rescue him right back." InStyle.com: Julia Roberts's Transformation . "Ghost" Technically, in this scene from the 1990 film, Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) is making out with Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg). But because Oda Mae is channeling Molly's late boyfriend Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze), it's Sam that Molly -- and the viewers -- get to see. "Titanic" Director James Cameron initially planned to cast "an Audrey Hepburn type" to play the female lead in this 1997 epic, and Leonardo DiCaprio nearly turned down his role. It's still captivating to see him woo Kate Winslet's Rose, even if, as DiCaprio said in a recent interview, kissing Kate is "like kissing a family member." InStyle.com: Kate Winslet's Transformation . "Spiderman" The upside down kiss that Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) shared with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) in this 2002 flick was breath-taking for Maguire, but not for the reasons you might think. "The whole time I had rainwater running up my nose," he said. "Then, when Kirsten rolled back the mask, she cut my air off completely." "Slumdog Millionaire" It was easy to see why Jamal (Dev Patel) was so hung up on his childhood friend Latika (Freida Pinto). When they finally kiss on a Mumbai train platform, it's a moment as exuberantly optimistic as the goofy dance scene that follows. Bonus points for still being a couple to this off-screen day. InStyle.com: Freida Pinto's Transformation . "Twilight" Even the most diehard members of Team Jacob can't deny the romantic power of Bella and Edward's first kiss. Kristen Stewart -- who's almost uniformly closemouthed about her off-screen relationship with costar Robert Pattinson -- did offer "I get to kiss Edward Cullen," when asked to name a few of her favorite things about the gig.

Summary A: In honor of Valentine's Day, InStyle.com has chosen the most memorable kisses in cinematic history. The list includes iconic scenes from "Gone with the Wind", "Lady and the Tramp", "Breakfast at Tiffany's", "When Harry Met Sally", "Pretty Woman", "Ghost", "Titanic", "Spiderman", "Slumdog Millionaire", and "Twilight". Each kiss, whether it was upside down, on a boat, or in the pouring rain, has left a lasting impression on audiences.

Summary B: InStyle.com celebrated Valentine's Day by compiling a list of the most memorable kisses in film history. The list includes the spaghetti kiss from 'Lady and the Tramp', the romantic alley kiss in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's', the New Year's Eve reconciliation in 'When Harry Met Sally', the pivotal kiss in 'Pretty Woman', the unique scene from 'Ghost', and the passionate kiss from 'Titanic'. These iconic moments also include scenes from 'Gone with the Wind' and 'Twilight'.

Article:
Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A federal audit of $9.1 billion targeted for reconstruction in Iraq cannot account for more than 95 percent of it, a federal report said Tuesday. The report, by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, blamed "weaknesses in DoD's [the Department of Defense's] financial and management controls" and called on the Pentagon to improve its financial and management controls. The audit centered on the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI), which was established in May 2003 by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). After the CPA was dissolved in June 2004, the Iraqi government authorized the U.S. government to administer the funds used for reconstruction. The Pentagon managed the DFI funds until the end of 2007, when its authority was withdrawn. The special inspector general reviewed records from eight Defense Department organizations that received DFI funds. "This situation occurred because most DoD organizations receiving DFI funds did not establish the required Department of the Treasury accounts and no DoD organization was designated as the executive agent for managing the use of DFI funds," the report concluded. "The breakdown in controls left the funds vulnerable to inappropriate uses and undetected loss."

Summary A: A federal audit of $9.1 billion allocated for reconstruction in Iraq has found that over 95% of the funds cannot be accounted for, according to a report by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. The report blamed "weaknesses in the Department of Defense's financial and management controls" and called for improved controls, highlighting that the lack of proper management left the funds vulnerable to misuse and undetected loss.

Summary B: The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction conducted a federal audit on the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI), revealing that over 95% of the $9.1 billion allocated for reconstruction in Iraq is unaccounted for. The DFI was established by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) in May 2003 and after the CPA was dissolved in June 2004, the Iraqi government authorized the U.S. government, specifically the Pentagon, to administer the funds used for reconstruction. The report blamed weaknesses in the Pentagon's financial and management controls.

Article:
DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- A former hospital employee may have exposed hundreds, or even thousands, of surgical patients to hepatitis C after taking their fentanyl injections and replacing them with used syringes filled with saline solution, authorities say. A hospital worker has admitted to secretly injecting herself and using unclean syringes for patients. Kristen Diane Parker, who worked at Rose Medical Center in Denver, has admitted to secretly injecting herself in a bathroom and using unclean syringes as replacements for patients, investigators said. She had hepatitis C, which she believes she contracted through using heroin and sharing dirty needles while she lived in New Jersey in 2008, authorities said. She was a surgical technician at Rose from October 2008 to April 2009. Nine patients who had surgery there during that time have tested positive for hepatitis C. Investigators are looking into whether they contracted the virus from Parker. According to an affidavit filed by an investigator with the Food and Drug Administration, Rose Medical Center knew Parker tested positive for hepatitis C. She was counseled on how to limit her exposure to patients. Parker quit after she was found to be in an operating room where she was not allowed to be. She subsequently tested positive for fentanyl. Hospital officials then contacted the DEA. Parker is in federal custody facing three drug-related charges. If she is found to have done serious harm to a patient, she could face up to 20 years in prison. If a patient dies because of her actions, she could face life in prison. In a statement to police, Parker said, "I can't take back what I did, but I will have to live with it for the rest of my life, and so does everyone else." Her attorney could not be reached Friday. Rose Medical Center is contacting 4,700 patients who had surgery at Rose during the time Parker was employed there. However, hospital officials do not believe that many patients were exposed. "We are taking a very conservative and cautious approach by contacting everyone who had surgery during this broad time period," a statement on the hospital's Web site said, adding, "It is likely that most of the patients who receive letters will not have been exposed to hepatitis C." An additional 1,200 patients may have been infected between May 4, 2009, and July 1, 2009, when Parker worked at Audubon Ambulatory Surgical Center in Colorado Springs. Audubon is also contacting patients. According to the Centers for Disease Control, hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.

Summary A: Kristen Diane Parker, a former employee at Rose Medical Center in Denver, Colorado, who worked from October 2008 to April 2009, admitted to secretly injecting herself with patients' fentanyl injections and replacing them with used syringes filled with saline solution. Parker, who had hepatitis C, believes she contracted the disease through heroin use and sharing dirty needles. Nine patients who had surgery during Parker's employment period have tested positive for hepatitis C, raising concerns that she may have exposed hundreds or even thousands of surgical patients to the virus.

Summary B: A former employee at Rose Medical Center in Denver, Kristen Diane Parker, may have exposed hundreds or thousands of patients to hepatitis C by using their fentanyl injections and replacing them with used, unclean syringes. Nine patients have tested positive for hepatitis C so far, and both Rose Medical Center and Audubon Ambulatory Surgical Center, where Parker also worked, are contacting potentially affected patients.

(CNN) -- Faced with a nationwide financial crisis, a volatile stock market and rising unemployment and inflation rates, many Americans are making changes in their personal spending habits. Single mother Ingrid Zaharris said financial woes forced her to take her daughter out of gymnastics classes. Ingrid Zaharris started cutting back drastically in May. She and her 6-year-old daughter moved into a smaller home in Allen, Texas, after realizing that she would be unable to afford the summer electricity bills coupled with the cost of rent for her house. Financial worries also forced Zaharris to take her daughter out of gymnastics classes and stop the lawn service. "I'm just trying to get back to basics," she said, adding that she has considered even getting rid of her car. "I'm just trying to get rid of those extra things just to get by." Zaharris is one of many iReporters who shared stories of dealing with a worsening economy. Like many others, she wonders how she wound up in such a tough financial situation. iReport.com: Read more of Zaharris' story . "Every day I ask myself, why does someone who has a salary over $80,000 struggle so much?" Zaharris wrote on iReport.com. "Gas costs more, groceries cost more, there are always checks to write for things at [my daughter's] school. The money just trickles away." Molly Zolad of Woodbridge, Illinois, said she's trying to simplify her life and make smart financial decisions. She stopped using credit cards and has made small day-to-day changes such as brewing her own coffee. "I had no idea how much waste I truly had in my life until the crunch of everything hit at once," she wrote on iReport.com. "Medical bills for myself, my two dogs, and the pay decrease from my company ... it all adds up." Zolad says the biggest sacrifice has been her time. She began a second part-time job at her church to earn extra money and avoid paying a baby sitter. She said her new lifestyle has made an "amazing difference." iReport.com: Read more of Zolad's story . Kathleen Fallon shared on iReport.com a list of several luxuries that she gave up such as cable, land-line phones, dining at restaurants and allowances for her children. She told CNN's Josh Levs that the sacrifices have been "a gift in some ways." "We're having more conversation, we're finding things to do as a family that are free, we play basketball, we play tennis. Homework's getting done better too."  Watch Levs' interview with Fallon » . John Stevens, on the other hand, is "scared to death." "I'm currently in a Chapter 13 to save my condo, but I don't even think that will work for me," he said. "The payment to the trustee every month is too high and along with the mortgage payment." Stevens works in the automotive industry and said his pay has been decreasing around $200 per month lately. He is considering changing careers, but says that many companies in his home state of Connecticut aren't hiring. According to a nationwide report released Tuesday by the American Psychological Association, as many as 80 percent of Americans are stressed about their personal finances and the economy. Nearly 7,000 Americans responded to the survey between April and September of this year. Within five months, anxiety about the economy rose from 66 percent to 80 percent. "I'm tired of what's going on and how the average citizen is suffering and our top leaders are more concerned with the big corporations and Wall Street," Stevens said. "I'm sad right now because I don't know how my future or even the next day is going to be." iReport.com: Read more of Stevens' story . iReporter Peter Cabrera also expressed anger about the Wall Street crisis because of the financial struggles affecting his parents. "Both my parents did everything the right way," said Cabrera, a doctoral student at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. "They worked hard, they saved." His father has retired early, Cabrera said, "and he's now watching his 401K disappear." iReport.com: See why Cabrera is 'terrified' for his parents . Mia Cole of Memphis, Tennessee, is making a major sacrifice because of financial struggles: She's giving up her ideal wedding. "Our dream wedding has turned into just that ... a dream," she wrote on iReport.com. "After months of no dinner dates, salon appointments or name-brand condiments, we managed to save a few thousand for a low-key dream wedding," she said. But in the two months since Cole and her fiancé were both laid off from their jobs, they have used that money to pay for everyday expenses. "More than likely we will go to a justice of the peace and say our vows and pray that in a few years when we are better and the country is better, our dream will come true," Cole said.

Article:
Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- At least 63 people were killed and 285 others were wounded in a series of explosions across the capital Tuesday, police said. The blasts included 14 car bombs, two roadside bombs and mortar attacks in at least 17 neighborhoods of the capital, most of them in Shiite neighborhoods, police said. In an earlier report, police said there had been three roadside bombs and a sticky bomb: a device typically placed on a vehicle. Explosions struck the Shiite neighborhoods of Kadhimiya in the northwest; Amil, Bayaa and Shulaa in the southwest; Ur and Zuhour in the northeast; Sadr City, Kamaliya and Amin in the east; and Abu Dhsir in the southern part of the city. Other blasts struck mixed Sunni-Shiite neighborhoods, including Waziriya, Yarmouk, Jihad and Eghraiat. "We are aware of multiple explosions in the Baghdad area with resultant casualties," the U.S. military said in response to a query from CNN. "At this time, no request for [U.S. Forces - Iraq] support has been made but we are providing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance coverage over some of the explosion sites." A U.S. military spokesman, Lt. Col. Eric Bloom, said the strikes are typical of al Qaeda in Iraq attacks. During the height of the Iraq war, sectarian violence tore through Baghdad on a daily basis in Sunni and Shiite neighborhoods. Also Tuesday, the Committee to Protect Journalists protested Iraq's move -- carried out Monday -- to close Al-Baghdadiya TV's offices in Baghdad and Basra. The decision came after the Cairo, Egypt-based satellite channel broadcast demands of gunmen who attacked a church in Baghdad on Sunday. The hours-long standoff ended after Iraqi security forces stormed the Sayidat al-Nejat church. In all, 58 people died, and 75 others were wounded; most of the casualties were women and children, the officials added. The Al-Baghdadiya bureau chief in Cairo, Abdelhamid al-Saih, told the journalists group that the shutdown was illegal since there was no judicial order and that he believed authorities were using the broadcast as a pretext to close the offices because the channel had previously given Iraqis the opportunity to criticize the government. "We are concerned by the closure of Al-Baghdadiya TV and demand that [the government's Communications and Media Commission] explain under what authority it has stormed the station's offices and censored it," said Mohamed Abdel Dayem, Middle East and North Africa program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. "We call on the authorities to allow the station to resume its operations immediately." According to the committee, the government commission said in a statement that the attackers had "contacted the station and selected it to be the exclusive platform for their inhumane practices with the purpose of disrupting Iraq's national unity and to inflame religious discord." It said, "the station's broadcast of demands 'amounts to incitement to violence' and that Al-Baghdadia's coverage was not objective, creating a threat to the military operation by providing attackers with information about ongoing operations to rescue the hostages." CNN's Arwa Damon contributed to this report.

Summary A: A series of attacks in Baghdad, Iraq, involving 14 car bombs and two roadside bombs targeted mostly Shiite neighborhoods, resulting in at least 63 deaths and 285 injuries. The U.S. military attributes these attacks to al Qaeda in Iraq.

Summary B: A series of explosions across Baghdad, Iraq, resulted in at least 63 deaths and 285 injuries, with the blasts predominantly occurring in Shiite neighborhoods. In related news, the Committee to Protect Journalists protested the closure of Al-Baghdadiya TV's offices in Baghdad and Basra, following the channel's broadcast of demands from gunmen who attacked a church, resulting in 58 deaths and 75 injuries.

Article:
WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The National Transportation Safety Board has released dramatic animation of two runway near-collisions this year to illustrate what the agency says is the need for improvements in runway safety. The NTSB animation shows two planes nearly colliding at the San Francisco International Airport in May. The first animation shows a Delta Air Lines Boeing 757 and a United Airlines Airbus A320 coming within 230 feet of colliding on the runway at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida in July. The re-creation was based on radar and flight data recorder information from the planes involved. The animation includes audio from the air traffic controller, who can be heard yelling, "Stop, stop, stop!" to the United plane as the Delta aircraft attempts to land.  Watch animation, hear controller's pleas » . The second animation shows a May incident at San Francisco International Airport in California in which a Republic Airlines jet takes off, coming within 35 feet of a SkyWest Airlines commuter turboprop that has just landed. There were no injuries in either situation. The videos were shown Thursday during the NTSB's annual "most wanted transportation safety improvements" board meeting, where the agency reviews its greatest concerns in transportation safety. The Federal Aviation Administration reported that serious runway incursions were reduced by 25 percent in 2007, but the NTSB said much work remains on runway safety and systems to notify pilots when they are about to collide with another plane or vehicle. NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker expressed frustration with the slow progress of implementing new technology, such as the use of a global positioning system-type procedure in cockpits that would help warn pilots of dangers on the runway. Rosenker told the NTSB-only panel, "It is time to do something before we have to investigate an accident that is catastrophic." Among the most wanted transportation safety improvements cited on the NTSB's Web site are items to "stop runway incursions/ground collisions of aircraft" with the notations "action needed by Federal Aviation Administration" and "unacceptable response." The site says systems the FAA has added to airports to warn air traffic controllers of potential collisions aren't "sufficient." "In recent incidents, [one system] did not alert controllers in time to be effective, and the situations were instead resolved by flight crew actions that sometimes bordered on heroics or just plain luck," the NTSB site says. "Until there is a system in place to positively control ground movements of all aircraft, with direct warning to pilots, the potential for this type of disaster will continue to be high." Rosenker told Thursday's board gathering that "this must be resolved." "We've had this recommendation for a number of years -- too many number of years," he said. Other areas of NTSB concern include fuel tanks on airplanes, pilot and air traffic controller fatigue, and technologies that could help prevent automobile collisions. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Eric Fiegel contributed to this report.

Summary A: The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has released animations of two runway near-collisions, one involving a Delta Air Lines Boeing 757 and a United Airlines Airbus A320 at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, and another at the San Francisco International Airport involving a Republic Airlines jet and a SkyWest Airlines commuter turboprop. These incidents underscore the need for improvements in runway safety.

Summary B: The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has highlighted the need for improvements in runway safety by releasing animations of two near-collisions at US airports. The incidents, which occurred at San Francisco International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, were shown at the NTSB's annual meeting discussing transportation safety improvements. NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker expressed frustration at the slow progress of implementing new technology to warn pilots of runway dangers, and called for action before a catastrophic accident occurs.

(CNN) -- Greek voters will go to the polls to elect a new government two years early, Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis announced Thursday. Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis says he wants to enact reforms in response to the international financial crisis. He called the early elections in response to pressure from the opposition Socialist Party, which threatened to block the election of a president in February if there was no general election first. Karamanlis is also seeking a mandate from the voters for reforms in response to the international financial crisis, he said. "It's up to the citizens to decide who has the right plan to govern and face the economic challenges," he said in a speech to the country. "We have two very difficult and critical years ahead of us," he said in the speech on Wednesday. "There is only one path that offers hope and potential: We take -- without delay, without procrastination -- take all necessary measures to address these problems. By design and desire. We need to build the solid foundation that will ultimately get us out of this crisis stronger." He said the country needs "stringent control on public spending," "war on tax-evasion" and "bold structural reforms." The new elections will be held October 4, Karamanlis announced Thursday after meeting President Karolos Papoulias, who officially dissolves parliament. Karamanlis' term was not due to expire until September 2011. But Socialist party leader George Papandreou insisted on new elections before the end of Papoulias' term as president in February. The Greek constitution requires the two major parties to agree on the election of a president, giving either party an effective veto. Karamanlis called Papandreou's stance "blackmail." Parliament will be dissolved on September 7, Karamanlis said on his Web site. Karamanlis' conservative New Democracy party suffered a sharp setback in European elections in June, when the Socialists matched New Democracy's tally of eight seats, with 36 percent of the vote. That election was seen as a litmus test for Karamanlis at a time of political and economic uncertainty with the economy shrinking and the country staring at a recession after nearly 15 years of high-profile growth. CNN's Efty Katsareas and Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.

Summary A: Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis has announced early elections, two years ahead of schedule, in response to pressure from the opposition Socialist Party. The move is also aimed at securing a mandate for reforms to address the international financial crisis, with Karamanlis calling for stringent control on public spending, a war on tax evasion, and bold structural reforms. The new elections will be held on October 4, following the dissolution of parliament on September 7.

Summary B: Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis, leader of the conservative New Democracy party, has announced early elections to be held on October 4, in response to pressure from the opposition Socialist Party and the international financial crisis. This decision was made after a meeting with President Karolos Papoulias, who officially dissolves parliament. The move comes as Socialist party leader George Papandreou insisted on new elections before the end of Papoulias' term as president in February, a requirement under the Greek constitution. The announcement follows a sharp setback for the New Democracy party in the European elections in June.

MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- A Spaniard has died from the human form of mad cow disease, the fifth such death in Spain since 2005, the Ministry of Health said in a statement late Friday. The victim died in January in the northern city of Santander, according to the statement, which did not provide further details. The victim was a woman who was hospitalized last fall, according to Juan Jose Badiola, director of Spain's national research center for mad cow disease. The ministry reiterated that there is no danger from eating meat in Spain. "The appearance of these sporadic cases is within the predictions that were made at the European level more than nine years ago," the ministry statement said. Ten years can pass between eating contaminated tissue and the appearance of the human form of the disease also called variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease, health officials say. The steps to avoid the disease, taken after the first cases of mad cow disease appeared in the United Kingdom, include isolating infected animals and prohibiting cattle feed of animal origin or with animal proteins, the ministry said. Three of Spain's five deaths from the disease were in the northern province of Leon. The city of Santander is in the nearby Cantabria province. Last September, officials reported the death of a woman from the human form of mad cow disease. Officials also said her son had died earlier from the same disease. It was believed to have been the first case in the world where two members of the same family have died from the disease, Badiola told CNN at the time. The mother, in her early 60s, died in August 2008. Her son, 41, died in February 2008, Badiola said. Badiola said it was the mother and son likely contracted the disease before stricter controls against mad cow disease began in Spain in 2001. The mother and son had similar eating habits, Badiola said, which included eating animal organs, such as kidneys and livers, and they may also have eaten animal brains. The mother and son were from a village in Leon province. The third fatality in that province was a woman, 50, a local government worker, who died in December 2007. The first confirmed death from mad cow disease in Spain was in 2005, when a young woman died near Madrid.

Summary A: A Spanish woman has become the fifth person in the country to die from the human form of mad cow disease since 2005, according to a statement from the Ministry of Health. The woman, who was hospitalized last fall, died in January in the northern city of Santander. Despite these deaths, the ministry maintains that there is no risk from consuming meat in Spain. The first confirmed death from mad cow disease in Spain was in 2005, and three of the five deaths have occurred in the northern province of Leon.

Summary B: A woman in Spain has died from the human form of mad cow disease, the fifth such death in the country since 2005. The victim was hospitalized last fall, according to Juan Jose Badiola, director of Spain's national research center for the disease. The Ministry of Health reassured the public that there is no danger from eating meat in Spain, stating that these sporadic cases were predicted over nine years ago. It's noted that ten years can pass between eating contaminated tissue and the appearance of the disease. Preventive measures include isolating infected animals and prohibiting cattle feed of animal origin. Notably, a mother and son from Leon province died from the disease in 2008, marking the first case where two members of the same family have died from the disease.

Article:
(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal is on track to win his fourth successive grand slam after Marcos Daniel was forced to retire during their first-round match at the Australian Open on Tuesday. World number one Nadal had already opened up a 6-0 5-0 lead before the Brazilian suffered a knee injury after 47 minutes of the match. Nadal, a nine-time major winner, is hoping to become the first player since Rod Laver in 1969 to win four consecutive Grand Slams. "I think I played right," the 24-year-old told the ATP Tour's website ahead of his next match against American debutant Ryan Sweeting, who is ranked 116th. "I played some good shots, some long shots. The serve can be a little bit better. That's the only point that I think I can improve." The Australian Open should be in February! British fifth seed Andy Murray progressed to round two after his opponent also became injured. Murray, who was a beaten finalist in Melbourne last year, led Slovakia's Karol Beck 6-3 6-1 4-2 when the world number 101 succumbed to a shoulder problem. The match lasted for one hour and 42 minutes before Beck withdrew, meaning the 23-year-old Murray will now face Illya Marchenko of the Ukraine who beat Spain's Ruben Ramirez Hidalgo. "I thought it was a pretty good match," said Murray. "Obviously you'd rather finish the match off without your opponent being hurt, but it does happen quite a lot. So you just have to move on and get yourself ready for the next round." Juan Martin del Potro scored a victory on his return to Grand Slam action, as he defeated Israel's Dudi Sela 7-6 6-4 6-4. Argentina's Del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open champion, has not played in one of the four majors since last year's Melbourne Park tournament after struggling with a wrist injury. "Today I played good tennis again," the former world number four said. "But I'm really enjoying this week. I met with all the players, especially the top-10 players. They supported me when I was very bad. So now I am face to face with them I can say thank you." Del Potro will now play the 2006 Australian Open champion Marcos Baghdatis, who beat Slovenia's Grega Zemlja 3-6 7-5 6-1 4-6 6-2. Australia's Lleyton Hewitt and David Nalbandian of Argentina played out a five-set clash which lasted four hours and 48 minutes at the Rod Laver Arena in a rematch of the 2002 Wimbledon final. Nalbandian eventually sealed a 3-6 6-4 3-6 7-6 9-7 victory, with the final set lasting 93 minutes, as he avenged that defeat and also his reverse to Hewitt in the 2005 Austalian Open quarterfinals. Lithuania's Ricardas Berankis will be Nalbandian's second-round opponent after he beat another Australian Marinko Matosevic 6-4 6-2 7-5. France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga came from two sets down to claim a 4-6 2-6 6-2 6-3 6-4 triumph over Philipp Petzschner of Germany. Tsonga, seeded 13th, eventually won the match after 194 minutes to set up a tie against Andreas Seppi after the Italian defeated Arnaud Clement. America's John Isner hit 26 aces on his way to a 6-3 7-6 6-3 win over Florent Serra of France. Isner is set to face Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic in the second round, who advanced at the expense of Deni Gremelmayr.

Summary A: Rafael Nadal is on course to win his fourth consecutive grand slam at the Australian Open, after his opponent Marcos Daniel retired due to a knee injury. Other notable matches include Andy Murray advancing to the second round due to his opponent's injury, Juan Martin del Potro's victorious return to Grand Slam action, and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga's comeback from two sets down to win his match.

Summary B: Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray advanced to the second round of the Australian Open after their respective opponents, Marcos Daniel and Karol Beck, had to retire due to injuries. Nadal is aiming for his fourth consecutive grand slam win.

Article:
Frankfurt, Germany (CNN) -- The man suspected of shooting and killing two U.S. Air Force servicemen in Germany was seeking revenge because of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, according to a warrant issued on Friday for the suspect. The suspect, Arid Uka, is a recently radicalized Muslim who seems to have been influenced by local radical Islamist websites, according to German authorities. Prosecutors say Uka shot and killed two U.S. servicemen and wounded two others in the attack Wednesday on a U.S. military bus at Frankfurt Airport. The arrest warrant for Uka lists two accusations of murder, three allegations of attempted murder and two accusations of causing severe bodily harm. The 21-year-old man said he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing a video on the internet the day before, which he claimed showed U.S. soldiers raping Muslim women, according to a German intelligence official who viewed a record of the suspect's interrogation. The suspect confessed to the shooting, and said that he acted alone with no helpers, the German intelligence official said Thursday. He was friends on Facebook with several pro-al Qaeda extremists from a group based in Bonn, Germany, that is known to German intelligence officials, according to the official. He also had links to an Islamist preacher named Pierre Vogel and someone named Nessery, who was arrested about two months ago in Afghanistan, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the investigation. The gunman was a postal worker at the airport, but worked outside the secure area. The U.S. official said Uka didn't appear to punch into work Wednesday -- having apparently canvassed the area beforehand, helping him get around the extensive uniformed and plain-clothes security that typically patrol the Frankfurt airport. Another U.S. official on Thursday said that Uka was "not on the radar screen" of American authorities prior to the attack. The suspect is from Mitrovica, a town in northern Kosovo, that country's interior minister, Bajram Rexhepi, told CNN. He cited the U.S. Embassy in Pristina as his source. The U.S. official with knowledge of the probe said Uka was a 1-year-old toddler when he moved to Germany, and that authorities believe Uka's relatives had suffered in the 1990s during the Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanians. He has passports from both Germany and Yugoslavia, the latter of which was issued prior to Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008, Rexhepi said. Uka told interrogators that he lived with his family in high-rise public housing in a poor area of Frankfurt, the German intelligence official said. He said he did not have a friendly relationship with people in the neighborhood and did not interact with others there. He said his father was very strict and harsh with him, according to the official. On Wednesday, he allegedly approached a bus, which was parked outside Terminal 2 and was clearly marked as a U.S. military vehicle, German police said after the shooting. According to the warrant, Uka asked a recruit where he was being deployed. The airman replied that he and his comrades were headed to Afghanistan. Uka then shot him in the back of the head with a handgun. The suspect then entered the bus, screamed "Alahu Akbar," and opened fire, killing the driver, the warrant says. Uka then shot two other passengers, wounding one in the head and the other in the chest, the warrant says. The suspect tried to shoot another serviceman but his gun jammed, it says. The suspect fled then fled into the terminal, where he was taken into custody by German federal police, according to the warrant. The suspect used a 9 mm handgun that was illegally purchased, Rhein said. One of the dead airmen was a vehicle operator at Ramstein, and the second was part of a security forces team based in the U.K., an Air Force spokesman said. The bus was occupied by 15 members of a security forces team that was on its way to Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany before deploying to Afghanistan, the spokesman said. Zachary Cuddeback was one of those killed, his grandfather, Daniel Cuddeback, told CNN. It's not clear if he was the vehicle operator or the member of the security forces team. A statement from his family described Cuddeback as a hockey player and "Army brat" with especially strong roots in Missouri in Virginia who joined the Air Force in 2009 after a year at Old Dominion University. The U.S. Defense Department on Thursday identified the other victim as Senior Airman Nicholas J. Alden, 25, of Williamston, South Carolina. He had been assigned to the 48th Security Forces Squadron based out of the Lakenheath air base in Great Britain. The two wounded airmen were in a Frankfurt hospital, one in critical condition and the other in serious condition, an Air Force spokesman said. President Barack Obama told reporters Wednesday he was "saddened and outraged" by the attack. "We will spare no effort in learning how this outrageous attack took place," he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said how upset she was by the incident, expressed her condolences to the troops' families and stressed that Germany will "do everything we can to try and find out quickly what happened." FBI agents were on the scene shortly after the shooting occurred, said Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director and CNN contributor. The FBI's main office in Germany is in the capital Berlin, he said, but it has a sub-office in Frankfurt. The offense is a federal crime both in the United States and in Germany, he said, and could be prosecuted in either location, although that will be determined later. However, the investigation will meet U.S. constitutional standards, he said. Authorities will be investigating the suspect's background and associates, likely subpoenaing telephone and e-mail records, Fuentes said. CNN's Ashley Hayes, Barbara Starr, Aaron Cooper and CNN investigative journalist Paul Cruickshank contributed to this report.

Summary A: Arid Uka, a radicalized Muslim, is suspected of shooting and killing two U.S. Air Force servicemen in Germany as revenge for U.S. military operations in Afghanistan. Uka, who was influenced by radical Islamist websites, shot the servicemen on a U.S. military bus at Frankfurt Airport. He confessed to the shooting, stating he was motivated by a video he saw online that allegedly showed U.S. soldiers raping Muslim women. Uka, who was not previously known to American authorities, was arrested and faces charges of murder, attempted murder, and causing severe bodily harm.

Summary B: Arid Uka, a radicalized Muslim from Mitrovica, Kosovo, shot and killed two U.S. Air Force servicemen, Zachary Cuddeback and Senior Airman Nicholas J. Alden, at Frankfurt Airport in Germany. Uka, influenced by local Islamist websites and connected to Islamist preacher Pierre Vogel and Nessery, an individual arrested in Afghanistan, was seeking revenge for U.S. military operations in Afghanistan. His family had suffered during the Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the 1990s.

SAMSON, Alabama (CNN)  -- As the crime scene tape starts to come down in this small Southern town, the residents are leaning on one another for comfort and the strength to move on. The shooter, Michael McLedon, killed his mother before killing others. First Baptist Church, a few feet from the neighborhood where Michael McLendon, 28, opened fire Tuesday, welcomed members of this close community Wednesday night for a prayer service. "It's what community is about, isn't it? Crying together. Holding each other," a pastor said. It's hard for many to believe the shooting rampage could happen in this town of about 2,100 people. Authorities said McLendon went to three towns, slaying 10 people. He started in his hometown of Kinston, killing his mother, before moving on to open fire in Samson and finally Geneva. McLendon was once a police officer in Samson, the small town hit hardest by the deadliest crime in Alabama history, authorities said. His nearly hourlong assault ended at the Reliable Metal Products plant in the last town, 24 miles from where it began and where police said McLendon engaged in a shootout before killing himself inside the building. In the aftermath of the rampage, among those seeking comfort at First Baptist Church was Josh Mathews. He was driving down the street around the time of the shootings. "Could've been anyone -- just missed the gunfire, could've been any of us," Mathews said.  Watch report from CNN's Brooke Baldwin » . After the shootings, he found out one of the victims was a friend. It will be hard to move on, he said. But "you have to. He was like the happiest dude in the world. He would've wanted us to move on and remember him for who he was." High school baseball coach Chris Reid said he knew almost all the victims. "Everybody knows everybody. Everybody's always been willing to go out of their way to help people in need around here, no matter what the case may be. It's just a small town where you consider your friends as family." Reid was walking out of the Big-Little convenience store when he stopped to talk to CNN. A little more than 24 hours ago, the gas station was the site of one of killings.  Watch deputy talk about his loss » . Reid was at baseball practice when he heard the shots. "They were one block from us, " Reid said, adding that while driving, he saw a man killed in the street. iReport.com: On the scene as officials investigate . "It really hasn't set in yet," he said. "It is still kind of a dream where you wait for it to not be real, to be over. But it's a fact, something we have to go through." Inside the church service, Steve Sellers, a visiting pastor, spoke to several hundred in attendance, praying for God to give the community strength. Some sat in the pews and sobbed. "I want to thank you, Lord, that in the coming days that this community walks through that process of healing, that there is a God who carries them through that valley," he said. Sellers also thanked town leaders, medical personnel and local law enforcement while asking the question that's been on so many minds: "I don't know what set a young man off like that, but I, too, want to pray for his family. We also come, knowing Lord, you taught us to forgive those who trespass against us."  Watch how state copes with "shock and disbelief" » . While members of this tight-knit town may never fully understand how McLendon could've committed this crime, many find comfort in faith and friends. As one pastor put it, "Thank God for this town."

Summary A: In Samson, Alabama, Michael McLendon embarked on a deadly shooting spree, killing 10 people, including his mother, before committing suicide at the Reliable Metal Products plant. The shaken community, including high school baseball coach Chris Reid and Josh Mathews, who narrowly escaped the gunfire and lost a friend, sought comfort at the First Baptist Church. Visiting pastor Steve Sellers led a prayer service, urging the community to find strength and forgiveness. This incident is the deadliest crime in Alabama's history.

Summary B: Michael McLendon, a former police officer, went on a shooting rampage in three towns in Alabama, killing 10 people including his mother, before killing himself. The small town of Samson, where McLendon was once an officer, was hit hardest by the deadliest crime in Alabama history, leaving the close-knit community in shock and seeking comfort in faith and each other.

Article:
LONDON, England (CNN) -- The election of 736 members from 27 member countries to the European Parliament in June will be the biggest transnational electoral contest there has ever been.  Between them they will represent more than 500,000,000 people. About 375 million EU citizens aged 18 or over are entitled to vote. But few understand how the low-profile Parliament affects the lives of EU citizens. Here are answers to the most frequently asked questions about the contest. Who will be voting, when and where? About 375 million EU citizens aged 18 or over are entitled to vote in the election of the parliament members for a five-year term. The elections will be held on Thursday, June 4 in the UK and the Netherlands. There will be voting on Friday, June 5 in Ireland and the Czech Republic. And it will begin on Saturday, June 6 in Cyprus, France, Italy, Latvia, Malta and Slovakia. The other countries will conduct their voting on Sunday, June 7. Elections will take place in all 27 member countries of the EU, with the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania included for the first time. How many MEPs are there and how many does each country elect? There will be 736 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in the new assembly. The number each country has varies according to its population. Germany, with a population of 82 million, the biggest among EU states, will have 99 members. Malta, with a total population of just 410,000, will have only 5. Will that number stay the same if the Lisbon Treaty comes into effect? No. The Lisbon Treaty, designed to give the EU a new streamlined constitution for the EU (and to increase the powers of the European Parliament,) has been put on ice following its rejection in a referendum in Ireland, the only country to give electors a direct voice. But the Irish are due to vote again in the autumn. If they then vote Yes and all remaining EU states ratify the treaty, then the Parliament will be increased from 736 to 751 members on a different distribution formula. That means that 15 'ghost MEPs', will be elected on June 7, entitled to attend the Parliament but not to vote in it until the Lisbon Treaty goes through. What election system is used? That varies according to the individual states represented, but all will be using some variant of proportional representation. In some countries candidates will all be on a single national list, making the entire country a constituency. Others elect MEPs from regional constituencies. Many countries set a threshold, insisting that parties have to gain an overall proportion of the vote -- 5 per cent in France and Germany, 4 per cent in Sweden or Austria -- to qualify for any allocation of seats. Whom do the MEPs represent? Most would-be MEPs contest the elections with the endorsement of national political parties. National parties such as the Christian Democrats in Germany or the Labour Party in Britain put up approved lists of candidates. But when they are in the European Parliament the MEPs mostly operate in wider groups of left or right such as the Socialist Group (PES), the Liberal Group (ELDR) or the European Greens. The main conservative grouping is the European Peoples Party (EPP). However, David Cameron, the national leader of Britain's Conservatives, has withdrawn his members from the EPP, regarding it as too federalist in its approach. The groups work as a bloc when they can and have "whips" designed to make them as cohesive as possible. What powers do the MEPs have? Much legislation in member states actually originates at a European level. National legislatures pass laws which have begun life as directives from the European Commission, the EU executive arm, which the MEPs have helped to shape. They are the only elected part of the European apparatus which is otherwise dominated by European Councils (meetings of the prime ministers or finance or trade or interior ministers from the 27 nations) or the European Commission. Do MEPs really make much difference to ordinary people's lives? It may not feel like it, day to day, but MEPs often have more influence over the shaping of European legislation which filters down to national parliaments than the members of those national parliaments do when the laws get to them. Recent EU laws which have affected citizens directly include the "roaming directive" which restricted the charges mobile phone companies can impose on customers for calls in countries other than their own. EU directives have helped initiate the era of cut-price air travel. It was the EU which determined that telephone and data companies had to keep records for at least two years to help counter terrorism . And the so-called "REACH" directive has forced businesses to disclose what chemicals they use in their products and to ensure that they are safe. Because driving legislation through the European Parliament requires the building of cross-party coalitions more than 50 percent of amendments proposed in the European Parliament end up as law. That is why company lobbyists spent much time in Brussels trying to make their case to MEPs. But does the Parliament have any muscle? It has the rather drastic power to sack the European Commission. It also holds public hearings on newly-appointed Commissioners. The Parliament also has significant powers over how much of the European Union budget is spent. Although most legislation originates with the Commission, if more than 50 percent of MEPs back a resolution calling for new laws in a particular area the the Commission has to get down to work to propose some. The EU is one of the largest aid donors in the world, dispensing some $15 billion a year across five continents and MEPs have a significant say in that. Where is the European Parliament situated? Most of its meetings are held in Brussels close to the officials whose draft legislation is examined by the Parliament's subject committees. But, at a considerable cost, some plenary meetings are also held in Strasbourg, an arrangement which the French government has fought long and hard to maintain.

Summary A: The European Parliament's June elections will include citizens of Bulgaria and Romania for the first time, with 375 million EU citizens eligible to vote. The Lisbon Treaty, which could increase the Parliament from 736 to 751 members, is currently on hold, but could affect the Parliament's composition if ratified.

Summary B: The European Parliament election in June will be the largest transnational electoral contest ever, electing 736 members from 27 countries to represent over 500 million people. The number of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) each country elects varies based on population, with Germany electing 99 and Malta electing 5. The election system varies by state, but all use some form of proportional representation. MEPs have significant influence over European legislation, which often filters down to national parliaments, and they have the power to sack the European Commission and influence the EU budget.

Article:
(CNN) -- Three times, Adrian Pracon prepared to die on Utoya island, a Norwegian paradise turned to hell Friday. Friends he laughed with earlier in the day fell one by one in a gunman's hail of fire. He survived to tell a horrifying tale Saturday. When the shooting started Friday afternoon, many of the 600 people at the ruling Labour Party's youth camp ran down a hill and to the water. The shooter came after them, screaming. "You are all going to die!" Pracon was one of the last ones remaining between the shooter and the water and didn't have time to take his heavy clothes or boots off. About 100 meters into the chilly water, he realized he would not make it. He would drown with all that weight. "I felt I couldn't breathe. I already swallowed too much water," he said. "I felt the clothes pulling me down." He managed to swim back to shore and crouched behind a boulder with others. But the gunman found him. He was so close that Pracon could see down the barrel of his weapon. He was sure to get a direct hit. Pracon thought he was going to die. Another survivor, Otzar Fagerheim, described the gunman as having blond hair and pale skin. He carried three guns, he said. At times, he shot those guns with disarming calm, like he was shooting photographs. He even smiled, Fagerheim said. Pracon was surprised to hear the shooter speaking Norwegian. He was certain a compatriot could never commit such a heinous act. Pracon spoke back. "Do you want to hurt a fellow Norwegian? Please, no. Don't shoot." Miraculously, the gunman pointed his weapon away. Instead, he aimed for those who were desperately trying to swim to safety. As though Pracon was too easy a target. As though it was more satisfying to shoot at a group of fleeing people, Pracon thought. He heard his friends begging for help. Some fell limp on Pracon. The gunman went away but returned to find Pracon again, hiding with about 10 others. The madness started again. More rounds of gunfire. He could hear so many of them say: "Please don't shoot me." One by one, their voices were silenced. A woman next to him was shot in the leg. Pracon could see her wound was gaping. Pracon clung to the dead. Tried to play dead. It was the only way he knew to survive. He heard footsteps getting closer. He could hear the heavy breathing of the man. Then, "boom!" Pracon's world fell silent. His hearing was gone. But he could feel intense pain on the back of his left shoulder. He bore it, lay face down, and kept perfectly still. "I am sure he intended to hit me in the head," Pracon said. The gunman missed by inches. 'I had to get out of there' That afternoon, before the carnage, Stine Renate Haheim spoke to her party's youth about violence against women and children. It's a big issue for the young member of parliament, who began her political career a decade ago in the youth movement. She came to idyllic Utoya island often for such gatherings -- 11 times, to be exact. It was "the most beautiful adventure of the summer," she said. She drew inspiration from Utoya. It was an important place for people from all over Norway to gather to discuss the future of their own nation as well as the problems plaguing other parts of the world. It was a place to get away from the daily grind, the day-to-day debates in parliament, and think big. And most of all, Haheim said, Utoya was a place of fraternity, of peace. "We love it there," she said. Everything changed Friday. It will be remembered from now on as a place where 85 people died, seemingly for no reason. Eskil Pedersen, a youth movement leader, assured everyone that they would be able to speak with counselors about the carnage they witnessed. "We will not be threatened to silence," he said. "We will continue fighting for what we believe in. This is the best way to honor the memory of those we have now lost. We will go back to Utoya." But it will be difficult. Haheim will hear the gunfire play over and over again in her head, just like she did Friday. After her speech Friday afternoon, she was informed about the explosion in downtown Oslo. Many of the youth camp attendees huddled for an informational meeting on what was happening to their colleagues in the government buildings. But when the shots rang out, the 600 people at the main building and surrounding camp scattered. Haheim quickly realized she should not be alone and followed others tumbling down the hill. Like Pracon, she hid behind boulders on the beach. When there was a lull in the shooting, she thought it was over. But then it started again. Terrifying minutes that seemed never-ending. She repositioned herself in another spot, away from the gunman's sight. She found herself with a girl, shivering in her underwear, who had shed her clothes in a desperate but failed bid to swim away. Haheim took off her jacket to warm her companion. "What is your name? Where are you from? Nice to meet you," they said to each other. "It was a conversation about nothing," Haheim said. That's how they found calm in that moment of fear. Haheim called her father, a police officer, on her mobile phone. "The police are on their way," he reassured her. She imagined that all the police and ambulances in the area had rushed to Oslo after the bombings. So her father's words gave her relief. Maybe the madness would end soon. Shortly thereafter, she could hear helicopters overhead, and vehicles with sirens in the distance. She was one of the older people at the gathering. She felt a sense of obligation to calm the younger people around her. Some were still in their teens. "You find some kind of way to get freakishly calm in that situation," she said. Finally, she heard someone say: "The police are here. We are safe." She hugged the man next to her. But within moments, the shooting began again. They had all been deceived -- the gunman was wearing a police uniform. "Run, run, run!" Haheim shouted. The rocks were slippery. She stumbled, fell, picked herself up. She had to keep running. "The only thing on my mind was that I had to get out of there," she said. 'Bloody, bloody mess' When real police officers finally showed up, the survivors were suspect. Were these more gunmen in uniform? "Everyone started screaming, crying, begging the police to throw away their weapons," Pracon said. After about a two-hour ordeal, Pracon and Haheim were rescued -- Haheim without injury and Pracon with a gunshot wound that was closed up at the hospital. Police arrested a man the Norwegian media identified as Anders Behring Breivik, 32, a Norwegian who apparently had taken issue with his homeland's growing multi-culturalism. It was only many hours later, in his hospital bed, that Pracon began realizing the magnitude of the "bloody, bloody mess." Recuperating after stitches Saturday, Pracon said fear was setting in anew. Now he would begin to discover the names of the dead. They were friends who would never again share a laugh with him. Police and rescue teams were still combing Utoya island -- 13 boats on the water and a meter-by-meter land search, said Sven Mollekleiv, president of Norwegian Red Cross. "We have now also mothers and fathers who don't know if their sons or daughters are alive," Mollekleiv said. "They are just waiting." Doctors cleared Pracon for solid food Saturday afternoon and he sought comfort in a plate of lasagna. "It was a perfect dinner for me right now," he said. A moment of joy, perhaps. But for Pracon, Haheim and other survivors of the slaughter, a long journey of healing lies ahead.

Summary A: Adrian Pracon, a survivor of the Utoya Island massacre in Norway, recounts his horrifying experience of the attack. He describes how the gunman, later identified as Anders Behring Breivik, targeted the attendees of a Labour Party youth camp, killing 85 people. Another survivor, Stine Renate Haheim, also shares her experience of the attack and the confusion caused by the gunman wearing a police uniform. The survivors now face a long journey of healing, while the families of the victims wait for confirmation of their loved ones' fates.

Summary B: Adrian Pracon and Otzar Fagerheim, survivors of the Utoya island shooting in Norway, recount their horrifying experiences. They were among the 600 people at the ruling Labour Party's youth camp when a gunman, described as having blond hair, pale skin, and speaking Norwegian, opened fire, killing 85 people.

New York (CNN) -- Aircraft will soon shoot high-resolution photos of the Long Island, New York, beach area where the search for a missing woman has led to the remains of at least eight people. Airplanes and helicopters will begin circling the barrier island beach later this week as federal, state and local search efforts continue, Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer told reporters on Wednesday. "The high-resolution technology should be able to provide a detailed representation of the area and will extend through Nassau County," Dormer said. "We're hoping the technology will help identify skeletal remains that may still be out there." The aerial imagery will supplement police-dog search units, which expected to resume searching later this week. Meanwhile, diver teams are already scouring the waterways on the north side of the barrier island. Eight different sets of confirmed human remains have been found in Suffolk County, Long Island, since December, in what police say could be the work of a serial killer or killers. Additional remains -- including a human skull -- were uncovered Monday. Police have not said whether the latest remains are from different people, or if they could have come from the eight victims. Some of the remains found Monday in a Nassau County wildlife preserve were wrapped in a "black plastic product" similar to a plastic bag, a law enforcement source said Wednesday. The remains "appeared to be part of a lower extremity," the source said. Medical examiner investigators are trying to determine the age and sex of the remains and attempt to find out how long they were at the location before being discovered. Federal agents first joined police in their investigation in December, after four bodies had been found. That discovery on a quarter-mile stretch of Oak Beach indicates that "they were dumped there by the same person or persons," Dormer told reporters at the time. "It's too coincidental that there were four bodies in the same location." They were all found stuffed in bushes along an isolated strip of waterfront property. The grisly find occurred as police searched for 24-year-old Shannan Gilbert, who was last seen alive in May 2010 in the Gilgo Beach area. Gilbert's sisters said Shannan was an escort who was visiting a client. They said she ran from the man's house and called 911, claiming that someone was trying to hurt her. In a strange series of events, a local resident -- who lives a few miles from where the remains were found -- said a young woman who "looked like she was partying all night" came to his door at about 5 a.m. on May 1. "She was screaming 'Help me, help me!' and said somebody was chasing her," said Gustav Coletti, who lives in the town of Oak Beach. He described the woman as a "young, light-brown-haired person in her early 20s." Coletti said he called 911 after opening his front door to the woman, prompting her to flee into the weeds along an embankment near his house. Moments later, Coletti said an "Asian-looking man" man driving a dark-colored sport utility vehicle pulled up alongside his home, looking for the woman. "Things got out of hand at a party and I'm just looking for her," Coletti quoted the man as saying. When Coletti told the man that he had called police, the man said he "should not have done that" and drove toward where girl had fled, Coletti said. But he says it took police more than four months to question him about the incident, potentially losing crucial evidence over that time frame. Coletti later told CNN that he believes the woman he saw that night was Gilbert. CNN can not independently verify that claim. Dormer said Wednesday that he has "no idea when the detective spoke to whomever you're talking about," referencing Coletti. Police said they received a written statement from Coletti in June. Gilbert's body has not been among the remains identified. CNN's Allan Chernoff and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report .

Summary A: Aircraft will soon be used to take high-resolution photos of the Long Island, New York, beach area where the search for a missing woman has led to the discovery of at least eight sets of human remains. The aerial imagery will supplement police-dog search units and diver teams, with the hope that the technology will help identify any additional skeletal remains. The remains found so far, some of which were wrapped in black plastic, could be the work of a serial killer or killers, according to police.

Summary B: In Long Island, New York, aircraft will be used to take high-resolution photos of a beach area where the search for a missing woman has led to the discovery of at least eight sets of human remains. Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer announced that the aerial imagery will supplement ongoing search efforts. Additional remains, including a human skull, were found in a Nassau County wildlife preserve, wrapped in a black plastic product. Medical examiner investigators are working to determine the age and sex of these remains.

Article:
OKAZAKI, Japan (CNN) -- At Spencer Morrey's home, there are two constant sounds: his dad, Craig, murmuring, "You're okay, Spence. You're okay, buddy," and the sound of a machine clearing the toddler's airway. Spencer Morrey, pictured with his father Craig, has severe cerebral palsy and requires 24-hour medical care. Both sounds come every few minutes, in between hugs, tears and kisses. Spencer has severe cerebral palsy and requires constant, 24-hour medical care. In Japan, a country that lacks sufficient medical services for disabled children, the only person to care for Spencer is his father. Morrey says his wife left, overwhelmed by the strain of their son's medical condition. That would be pain beyond what most parents could imagine. But Spencer's mother fled while pregnant with Morrey's daughter, Amelia. In more than a year, Morrey says he has only seen his daughter four times. "She wouldn't recognize me," Morrey said, with Spencer propped on his lap. "She wouldn't call me daddy. She's just starting to talk now. But she's not going to know who I am. I think she deserves my love. And I think she deserves to be with Spencer and Spencer deserves to be with her." Morrey, a native of Chicago and a U.S. citizen, was married to a Brazilian woman of Japanese descent. They divorced in a Japanese court. Under Brazilian law, Morrey would likely have joint custody and guardianship of both children. What do you think about Spencer's case? Have your say . But in Japan, where only one parent gets custody of a child in a divorce, the family courts have left the case in legal limbo for a year because they have not decided which parent legally has custody of the children. Typically, the parent with physical custody of a child retains custody. Morrey has stayed in Japan the last year, trying to get the courts to recognize that he has joint custody of the children in Brazil (he has not yet applied for such custody under U.S. law).  Watch Kyung Lah's report on the case » . He is afraid that if he heads home for the U.S. with Spencer without that, he could be subject to international child abduction laws, and he also fears such a move could hurt his chances of getting the Japanese family court to give him joint custody of his daughter. Morrey has been forced to quit work to care for Spencer. The financial strain of living off his credit cards is adding to the stress of caring for a disabled child alone in a foreign country. Despite his pleading with court mediators and repeated court filings claiming that joint custody is the law in both the U.S. and Brazil, Japan's slow and antiquated family courts have let the case languish. "Kids need both parents," Morrey said. "Whether the parents are married or not is irrelevant in my mind. The Japanese courts, and I realize you're going against years and years of cultural differences and everything else, but they don't care about the welfare of the child. "In Japan, it's considered too messy. It's too complicated. It deals with personal feelings, so they don't want to deal with it. So the best way is to not deal with it." CNN contacted Morrey's ex-wife four times by telephone and once by fax. She declined to discuss the case. The International Association for Parent and Child Reunion believes there are an estimated 100 American families in situations like Morrey's in Japan and dozens involving those from Britain, France and Canada. One of those cases is that of American Christopher Savoie. Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, was arrested on September 28 in Yanagawa, Japan, for attempting to abduct his two children, eight-year-old Isaac and six-year-old Rebecca.  Watch more about this case » . Savoie drove his children to the nearest U.S. consulate in the city of Fukuoka to try and obtain passports for them. Steps away from the front of the consulate, Japanese police arrested him. Savoie is now in jail, awaiting a decision by prosecutors on a possible indictment. Savoie and his first wife, Noriko Savoie, were married for 14 years before their bitter divorce in January. According to court documents, she fled with the children to Japan in the summer. A U.S. court then gave Christopher Savoie sole custody of the children. But Japanese law recognizes Noriko Savoie as the sole custodian, despite the U.S. order. "It's like a black hole," Morrey said. "If you go through a divorce, there's this joke. If you have an international marriage with a Japanese, don't piss them off because you'll never see your kids again." Not seeing his daughter Amelia again is what is keeping Morrey in Japan. He has been selling off everything he owns, trying to keep himself and Spencer afloat, hoping the Japanese court will bring him some legal connection to his child. He is stuck choosing between caring for his son, who needs the better resources of the U.S., and hoping to be a father to his daughter. "How do you make that choice? It's not -- once you're a dad, you're always a dad."

Summary A: Craig Morrey, a U.S. citizen living in Japan, is the sole caregiver for his son, Spencer Morrey, who has severe cerebral palsy. His wife, a Brazilian woman of Japanese descent, left due to the strain of their son's medical condition and took their daughter, Amelia, with her. Under Brazilian law, Morrey would likely have joint custody of both children.

Summary B: Spencer Morrey, a toddler with severe cerebral palsy, requires 24-hour care in Japan, a country with insufficient medical services for disabled children. His father, Craig Morrey, a U.S. citizen, is the sole caregiver after his wife left due to the strain of their son's condition. Morrey is in a legal battle for custody of his daughter, Amelia, with the Japanese courts, which typically grant custody to the parent with physical custody. Morrey is unable to return to the U.S. with his son due to fears of international child abduction laws and potential damage to his custody case, leading to financial strain and the challenge of caring for a disabled child alone in a foreign country.

Article:
New York (CNN) -- Not everyone expects a response when they write a letter to the president of the United States. But Caroline Jamieson got much more than she expected when her husband ended up in jail and afraid he would be deported. Jamieson, vice president of marketing at a new-media advertising company, wrote President Barack Obama in January because her husband, Hervé Fonkou Takoulo, was facing deportation to his native Cameroon. Takoulo failed in a bid before political asylum almost a decade ago, and a judge issued a deportation order after they were married. After he and Jamieson married on 2005, Takoulo applied for a green card based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen. But immigration law requires that the deportation order be lifted before the couple can appear before immigration officials to argue their case that the marriage is legitimate and not a ploy to legalize Takoulo's presence in the United States. "We want to be given the chance to interview and prove that we are a married couple, so Hervé can get a green card, and that has proven extremely difficult to do," Jamieson told CNN. They never received a direct response to the letter. But they did get two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers waiting outside their East Village, Manhattan apartment on June 3 when Takoulo was leaving the apartment to go to the gym. Jamieson told CNN that the officers cornered her husband and asked him if he had written a letter to the president. "He said 'No, but my wife did.' And they explained that with that letter -- when it was brought to their attention -- that the Obama administration wanted them to resolve this quickly,'" Jamieson said. Her husband was held at ICE headquarters for six hours, alone in a room, until he was chained at the wrists, around his stomach and his ankles and taken to the Hudson County Correctional Center in New Jersey, she said. For the next two weeks, a frantic Jamieson wrote letters to politicians and anyone else who might be able to help. She got responses, she said, but none seemed to lead anywhere. Takoulo was allowed to call his wife once a day at designated times but he knew little about his situation. He spent his days with repeat sex offenders and men accused of felonies, fearing imminent deportation. "I did everything I could and went into survival mode and pushed for all these connections to the press," she said. "We are fortunate to have that leverage. What about the people in the country who don't have access to those means?" Then, on Thursday, he was brought to an immigration processing jail in Manhattan and released. There was no explanation offered for his release, but Takoulo is now wearing an electronic ankle monitor while his case is being reviewed. ICE spokesman Brian P. Hale said the circumstances of Takoulo's arrest were undergoing an internal review and he was released as "an alternative to detention pending a review of his case." Investigators are looking to determine whether "appropriate separation" between Jamieson's letter to the president and Takoulo's deportation case were violated. If so, he said, the case will go to the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility and the Homeland Security Department's inspector general for "immediate and appropriate action." Takoulo graduated from the State University of New York at Stony Brook with an engineering degree in 2008 and received several job interview offers after graduation. But the deportation order hung over his head and prevented any followup. "All he wants to do is contribute to this economy," Jamieson told CNN. "We want to be a productive couple. He's been dying to work." The couple has been following Barack Obama's rise in the political world since 2004. "I felt a special kinship to him because I'm of mixed race, and my husband obviously has a similar background," Jamieson told CNN. Regardless of whether or not her letter was mishandled, the incident has deeply affected the couple's faith in the Obama administration. "I feel really confused, I don't understand how something like this is possible. I can't imagine that at the top of the Obama administration that they realize that something like this is happening," Jamieson told CNN.

Summary A: Caroline Jamieson, vice president of marketing at a new-media advertising company, wrote a letter to President Obama when her husband, Hervé Fonkou Takoulo, faced deportation to Cameroon after a failed bid for political asylum. After the letter, Takoulo was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and held in detention for two weeks before being released with an electronic ankle monitor. The circumstances of Takoulo's arrest are under internal review, with investigators determining whether there was an "appropriate separation" between Jamieson's letter and Takoulo's deportation case.

Summary B: After Caroline Jamieson wrote to President Obama about her husband Hervé Fonkou Takoulo's deportation order, two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers arrested Takoulo. He was detained at the Hudson County Correctional Center in New Jersey, where he spent his days fearing imminent deportation, despite being married to a U.S. citizen and having a pending green card application.

Article:
Teresopolis, Brazil (CNN) -- Leticia Lima was buried up to her neck in mud. Her forehead was crushed and her teeth knocked out. "I remember my mother shouting, and a loud noise. I hugged my baby tight. That's the last thing I remember," she said, lying bandaged in a hospital bed. Her baby and her mother didn't make it. They were among at least 759 people killed after flooding and massive mudslides flattened houses and wiped out entire neighborhoods in hillside towns of Rio de Janeiro state last week. Other states in the South American country have also seen heavy rainfall. Last week, authorities in neighboring Sao Paulo state said 24 people had been killed by flooding. Victims like Leticia Lima repeat stories of loss and survival throughout the Clinical Hospital of Teresopolis -- located in one of the hardest hit cities. "On the first day, we treated 178 people in less than 12 hours," hospital director Rosane Rodrigues Costa said. Liziel Madureira was one of them. He managed to grab his 5-year-old son, but saw half of his family swept away. He then went on to save his neighbor and her three children. "I would do it all again," he said. "What else could I do?" His 18-year-old daughter Erica also survived -- by climbing into a refrigerator. "It shook and shook," she said. "I opened the door and it was floating." She cried as she recounted the experience, and said the family was still searching for her mother's body. As the rains subside, donations are pouring in from around the country.

Article:
New York (CNN) -- The serendipitous occurrence of this year's Thanksgiving holiday on the same evening as the Muslim Eid-ul-Adha is a festive occasion to reflect on the place of Islam in American collective consciousness and on Muslims as Americans. On the same evening that millions of Americans gather around their Thanksgiving dinner to celebrate this most American of holidays, even more millions of Muslims around the globe, including the growing number of American Muslims, will do the same -- celebrating as well one of the most definitive moments of their faith -- Prophet Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son for his God. This holiday celebration comes soon after the tragic incident at Fort Hood, when the atrocious act of a mass murderer put Islam and Muslims under some pressure to either denounce or defend their faith. The psychotic act of Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, MD, a Muslim American military psychiatrist at Fort Hood who went on a rampage killing 13 U.S. soldiers and wounding 30 others, has prompted two diametrically opposed reactions. On one side are people who say that Islam -- and Islam alone -- is inherently violent and by extension Muslims are constitutionally driven to murder, while on the other are apologetic Muslims who argue their faith is peaceful and benevolent -- unrelated to criminal acts such as Hasan's. The fact is that Maj. Hasan and Osama bin Laden have as much claim on Islam as do Muhammad Ali, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the Persian poet Mawlana Jalal al-Din Rumi, who is the best-selling poet in America. Islam is an abstraction and any Muslim, saintly or satanic, detested or beloved, can and does have a claim on it -- and Islam is not the only world religion with this proclivity for good and evil. The distinguished New York Times columnist David Brooks, one of the most consistently militant warriors in his take on American involvements in Afghanistan and Iraq, takes Islam -- and Islam alone -- to task for having a diabolic roughness on its fringes. But even if so, Islam is not alone in this failure to curtail murderous instincts. The same Hinduism that produced Mahatma Gandhi and his non-violent theory of civil disobedience has also produced Hindu fundamentalists who sliced and skewered pregnant Muslim women alive in Gujarat. The same Christianity that produced Saint Francis of Assisi and Mother Theresa also produced children's crusades and Spanish conquistadors who burned native Americans alive 13 at a time (according to the 16th-century Spanish Dominican priest, Bartolomé de las Casas) in honor of the Twelve Apostles and Jesus Christ. It also produced American Seung-Hui Cho who killed 32 students and himself at Virginia Tech and American John Wayne Gacy, Jr., who raped and murdered 33 young men and boys in Chicago, Illinois, in the 1970s. The same Judaism that produced Martin Buber, Emanuel Levinas, or Primo Levi also produced the Stern Gang, Meir Kahane and Baruch Goldstein. But the knee jerk reaction of blaming Islam and Muslims, in general, or looking for delusional links to "al Qaeda," for the horrific murders at Fort Hood points to something far more fundamental, overdue, and urgent -- namely something of a psychological barrier for Americans to accept the Islamic component of their own society, culture, and history. To avoid singling out Islam as diabolical, it is imperative for Americans to come to terms with the collectively repressed fact that by far the most important social uprising of their 20th century -- namely the civil rights movement of the 1960s -- is not as exclusively a Christian phenomenon as it is made out to be: The towering figure of a Muslim revolutionary named Malcolm X is of great importance in the history of that movement. It took a whole generation of Americans to accept the fact that Jewish civil rights activists were instrumental in many measures of the success that was achieved in the 1960s. It is long overdue for Americans also to recognize that Malcolm X was equally, if not more, important to the civil rights movement. The way the history of the civil rights movement is mostly remembered now, an overwhelming role is assigned to the Southern Baptist genealogy of Martin Luther King Jr. Malcolm X is delegated to a radical fringe -- portrayed as more of a menace and a hindrance than a positive force in the civil rights movement. But without the simultaneous presence of Malcolm X as a Muslim revolutionary, the Southern Baptist pacifism of Martin Luther King Jr. would not have been as formidable a force. Malcolm X and Martin Luther King were the yin and yang of the civil rights movement -- ennobling anger and vision coming together in hopes of realizing the dream of equality. For more than three decades now, I have taught generations of American students who come to college having scarce read a word about Malcolm X, and yet everything about Martin Luther King Jr. Until Americans come to terms with the fact that they are deeply indebted to a Muslim revolutionary for the fruits of the civil rights movement they enjoy today, Islam and Muslims will continue to be seen as archetypically alien and an everlasting danger to American lives and liberties. Americans are Christians, Jews, Hindus, agnostics, atheists, and anything else in between -- but Americans are also Muslims, millions of them, and Islam has now become integral to what the distinguished American sociologist Robert Bellah termed our "civil religion." It is only apt that this particular Thanksgiving, Americans think about Eid-ul-Adha, as precious to Muslim-Americans as the occasion that has gathered us all "at the table." Let's make room for Muslims "at the table" because -- to quote Langston Hughes -- they "too, sing America." The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi.

Summary A: The article discusses the simultaneous occurrence of Thanksgiving and the Muslim holiday Eid-ul-Adha, using it as a platform to reflect on the place of Islam in American society, particularly in light of the Fort Hood incident. The author argues that Americans need to acknowledge the significant role of Muslims in their society and history, particularly highlighting the contribution of Muslim revolutionary Malcolm X to the civil rights movement, and urges for the inclusion of Muslims in the American "civil religion."

Summary B: The coinciding of Thanksgiving and the Muslim holiday Eid-ul-Adha provides an opportunity to reflect on the place of Islam in American society, especially following the Fort Hood incident involving Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan. This event sparked debates about the nature of Islam and its followers, with figures like Hasan and Osama bin Laden often being used to represent the faith.

(CNN) -- A self-help expert said Tuesday that he has hired his own investigators to determine what happened at his Arizona retreat last week, when two people died after spending considerable time in a sweat lodge. Self-help author James Arthur Ray has hired investigators to investigate two deaths at an Arizona sweat lodge. Tuesday's tearful speech before about 200 supporters was the first time that best-selling self-help author James Arthur Ray had publicly discussed the case. Authorities said James Shore of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Kirby Brown of Westtown, New York, died Friday at the Angel Valley Resort after spending up to two hours in the sauna-like sweat lodge. Nineteen others were treated for injuries. "I have no idea what happened. We'll figure it out," Ray said, adding that he had hired investigators. "I've lost people I love and really care about." Police are also investigating the incident at the central Arizona resort, located in a secluded valley 20 minutes from Sedona. Ray is the author of the best-selling book "Harmonic Wealth: The Secret of Attracting the Life You Want." Ray, described on his Web site as a "personal success strategist," has appeared on CNN's "Larry King Live" and the "Oprah Winfrey Show," and is featured in the self-empowerment film "The Secret." On Tuesday, Ray told the crowd that he is struggling with the deaths. "These are challenging times," he said. "I've faced many; none like this. I don't know how to deal with it really." The use of sweat lodges for spiritual and physical cleansing is a part of several Native American tribes' cultures. A traditional Native American sweat lodge is a small dome-like structure made up of willow branches carefully tied together and covered in canvas. Rocks are heated in a nearby fire pit and placed inside the lodge, and water is poured over them to create steam. CNN's Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report.

Summary A: Self-help author James Arthur Ray has hired private investigators to look into the deaths of two people at his Arizona retreat, who died after spending two hours in a sweat lodge. Ray, who is also under police investigation, expressed his struggle with the incident, stating he has "lost people I love and really care about."

Summary B: Following the deaths of James Shore and Kirby Brown at the Angel Valley Resort in Arizona, self-help author James Arthur Ray has enlisted private investigators to determine what transpired. The incident, which occurred after the victims spent a significant amount of time in a sweat lodge, is also under police investigation.

(CNN)  -- Didier Drogba muscled his way through for a late winner to put Chelsea into the FA Cup final with a 2-1 victory over Arsenal at Wembley on Saturday. A bare-chested Drogba is congratulated by Salomon Kalou after scoring the winner at Wembley. The all-London clash rarely hit the heights on a difficult pitch, but Drogba's 84th minute strike gave Guus Hiddink's men a deserved victory and leaves them in contention for three trophies. Dutchman Hiddink, who took temporary charge of the Blues in February and has lost only one match, said Drogba had proved his worth again. "He is proving already he is so dangerous, very strong and physically fit," he told Press Association. "We respect each other very much but also challenge each other without thinking this is a big name." Arsenal went ahead in the 18th minute as Theo Walcott's volley deflected past Petr Cech, but Florent Malouda equalized for Chelsea just after the half hour mark. Chelsea looked the stronger against an Arsenal team missing key defenders and goalkeeper Manuel Almunia and it came as no surprise when Ivory Coast star Drogba scored a typical winner. He latched on to Frank Lampard's hopeful volleyed through ball, shrugged off Mikael Silvestre before rounding Lukasz Fabianksi to roll the ball into an empty net. Ivory Coast international Drogba scored the winning goal against Manchester United in the 2007 FA Cup final and may get the chance to repeat the trick. Quintuple chasing United play Everton in the second semifinal, also at Wembley, on Sunday. Chelsea, who are a still challenging third in the Premier League and semifinals of the Champions League, showed their character after falling behind to Walcott's strike. The England international winger connected with a chipped cross from Kieran Gibbs and his effort took a cruel deflection off Ashley Cole's arm to beat Cech. Arsenal had made a fine start, but without injured central defender William Gallas and with Fabianski showing a lack of authority in goal, Chelsea came back strongly into the game. Malouda went close with a cross shot which eluded Fabianski, but he was not be denied soon afterwards as picked out by Lampard he cut inside Emmanuel Eboue and beat Fabianski at his near post. More slack defending from Denilson allowed Nicolas Anelka time to shoot and his shot hit the post with Fabianski beaten. Walcott looked occasionally dangerous on the flank and twice sent in crosses which might have been converted, but Chelsea looked the more threatening and the teams were spared extra time when Drogba powered through to score. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was left to rue their defensive errors and the performance of his 20-year-old Polish goalkeeper. "He's a great goalkeeper but it was not his greatest day," Wenger said. "Inexperience, yes. It was a game when any mistake could be costly."

Summary A: Chelsea secured a place in the FA Cup final with a 2-1 victory over Arsenal, thanks to a late goal from Didier Drogba. Arsenal initially took the lead with a goal from Theo Walcott, but Florent Malouda equalized for Chelsea, setting the stage for Drogba's winning strike in the 84th minute. The win leaves Chelsea in contention for three trophies and marks another success for interim manager Guus Hiddink, who has only lost one match since taking charge in February.

Summary B: Chelsea, under the temporary leadership of Guus Hiddink, won the FA Cup final against Arsenal with a 2-1 victory, thanks to a late goal by Didier Drogba. Arsenal had initially taken the lead in the 18th minute.

(CNN) -- Somalia's hard-line Islamic group Al-Shabab seized control of Jowhar, the president's hometown, after a battle with pro-government forces Sunday. An Islamist fighter mans a position in the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia, on Saturday. Jowhar is a major town 55 miles (88 kilometers) southeast of Mogadishu, the capital. "All businesses are closed and residents are already fleeing while Al-Shabab are roaming the streets," a local journalist said. The town had been under the control of forces backing the transitional government, which is scrambling to cope with deadly advances from Al-Shabab in Mogadishu. Al-Shabab was once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union, which took over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006. The United States says the group is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network, and the U.S. backed an Ethiopian invasion that drove the ICU from power in 2006. After seizing control of Jowhar on Sunday, the rebels started conducting "search operations in the police station and the provincial headquarters of the town," the journalist added. The clashes extended into the suburbs of the town, where sporadic fighting was going on between the rebels and government forces, said the journalist, who requested anonymity for safety reasons. The town's seizure comes amid escalating tension between Somalia's transitional government and the Al-Shabab militia, which has waged days-long attacks in the capital. In the latest round of violence, one person was killed and 15 others wounded when mortars slammed into a police academy in Mogadishu on Sunday. Clashes between the rebels and the government in Mogadishu have left at least 103 people dead and 420 wounded, Somali officials said Friday. The east African nation has not had an effective government since 1991. Last week, a spokesman for the rebel group said that it had successfully recruited more fighters. "It is not only Somali jihadists that are fighting in Mogadishu against the government," said Sheikh Hassan Ya'qub, a spokesman for Al-Shabab. "There are also foreign Muslim jihadist brothers who are fighting side by side with us." The new round of fighting stems from an interpretation of sharia, or Islamic law, the spokesman said. Somalia's new president, Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, recently approved implementing sharia, but the rebel group wants the country to institute a stricter form. Meanwhile, a powerful Islamist warlord defected to the government Saturday after he disagreed with rebel Islamist groups on the war against the transitional government. The warlord, Sheikh Yusuf Mohamud Siad Indha Ade, was the military commander of Hassan Dahir Aweys, who is suspected by the United States of being a terrorist.

Summary A: The hard-line Islamic group Al-Shabab has seized control of Jowhar, the president's hometown, in Somalia after a battle with pro-government forces. This comes amid escalating tension between Somalia's transitional government and the Al-Shabab militia, with the latter demanding a stricter form of sharia law, and follows a series of deadly advances from Al-Shabab in the capital, Mogadishu.

Summary B: Al-Shabab, an Islamic group linked to Al Qaeda, has taken over Jowhar, the president's hometown, from forces backing the transitional government. The group, once part of the Islamic Courts Union, has been making deadly advances in Mogadishu. The U.S. supported an Ethiopian invasion in 2006 that removed the Islamic Courts Union from power. Al-Shabab's spokesman, Sheikh Hassan Ya'qub, stated that the current conflict is due to differing interpretations of Sharia law.

Article:
San Francisco, California (CNN) -- Officials have agreed to pay $1.5 million to the daughter of a man fatally shot in the back by a transit police officer on New Year's Day 2009 in Oakland, California. A bystander's cell-phone video of the shooting on a transit platform was widely circulated on the Internet and on news shows. The Bay Area Rapid Transit train system late Wednesday announced the settlement over the killing of Oscar Grant, 22. "It's been a little over a year since we experienced the tragic death of Oscar Grant," BART Board President James Fang said. "No matter what anyone's opinion of the case may be, the sad fact remains this incident has left Tatiana without a father. The $1.5 million settlement will provide financial support for her."  Grant's daughter, Tatiana, is 5. The video showed then-Officer Johannes Mehserle, 27, pulling his gun and shooting Grant in the back as another officer kneeled on Grant. Mehserle might have intended to draw and fire his Taser rather than his gun, according to a court filing by his attorney. The shooting sparked large protests in Oakland and led to Mehserle's arrest on a murder charge. The case against him is pending. Initially, attorney John Burris asked for $50 million in a wrongful-death lawsuit filed on behalf of Grant's daughter. Burris was not immediately available for comment on the settlement. The transit system's police department has made several changes since the shooting. The department has increased training hours for officers, is requiring them to report all "use-of-force incidents," and is tapping the public's help in searching for a new police chief, the transit system said in a statement. "This settlement is critical in our efforts to move forward," said Carole Ward Allen, a BART board member. "We're working hard to make the police department the best it can be for our officers, our customers and our community."

Summary A: The Bay Area Rapid Transit train system has agreed to pay $1.5 million to Tatiana, the daughter of Oscar Grant, who was fatally shot by a transit police officer on a platform in Oakland, California on New Year's Day 2009. The settlement is intended to provide financial support for Tatiana, who is now left without a father.

Summary B: Officials have agreed to a $1.5 million settlement for the daughter of Oscar Grant, a man fatally shot by a transit police officer in Oakland, California on New Year's Day 2009. The Bay Area Rapid Transit system has since made several changes, including increased training for officers and requiring them to report all "use-of-force incidents."
