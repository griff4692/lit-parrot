Article:
Catania, Sicily (CNN)We are at the beginning of a massive and mounting crisis with no solution in sight. Perhaps that's incorrect. The migrant crisis that has suddenly drawn hundreds of journalists to Sicily has been brewing for years, but in the past 10 days, with as many as 1,600 deaths in the Mediterranean, suddenly minds are focused -- for now. Almost exactly four years ago, in Libya, I caught, perhaps, a glimpse of what was to come. It was late at night in the besieged city of Misrata. Hundreds of African migrants were caught between the Libyan civil war (back then some optimistically called it a "revolution") and the deep blue sea. They had come to Misrata from Ghana, Nigeria and elsewhere, hoping to board rickety boats to cross the sea to Europe. They had been pinned down under sporadic shelling from government forces, but weren't welcome by the rebels who controlled the city. They appealed to us to help them escape. We could do nothing, but they may have eventually found their way out when the fighting subsided. The fall of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's regime, which we reporters covered so avidly, was followed by chaos, which we in the news media largely neglected, focused as we journalists were on the next catastrophe, the Syrian civil war. In that chaos, the business of human trafficking has boomed. And now that boom in human misery is coming in waves to the shores of Italy. The focus today is on those lost at sea. Aware of the tragedy underway, however, Italians are alarmed at the prospect that this year alone as many as a million migrants could arrive in Europe, according to one European Union official. That is certainly the case in the Sicilian port of Catania, where many migrants arrive. The city's mayor, Enzo Bianco, insists city residents bear no ill will toward the migrants, but says Catania, and Sicily cannot absorb the ever-growing numbers. The rest of Europe must help carry the burden. "If something serious isn't done," he warns, "dramas like these will be repeated. This problem will not be resolved by hiding our heads in the sand." Increasingly, some Italians are losing their patience. Two northern regions, Veneto and Valle d'Aosta, have declared they will no longer accept new migrants. The rightist Lega Nord has made opposition to new migrants a pillar of its party program. Others, however, insist Italy must keep its doors open. In Catania port, I spoke with Grazia Giurato, who had joined a small protest in solidarity with the migrants. "Many years ago, our grandparents emigrated," she recalled. "Let's keep that in mind." Indeed, in tougher times, millions of impoverished Italians left their homeland to settle in the Americas and Australia. They, too, like the migrants from Africa and the Middle East, were fleeing grinding poverty and war. And they, too, experienced the kind of prejudice and resentment in lands their descendants now proudly call home. That's the long view, perhaps. But now, today, Italians are grappling to deal with the consequences of an array of old and new ills, ranging from failing states and failing economies to endemic corruption, hopeless poverty, oppression and injustice that no one state or group of states can solve without a gargantuan, expensive and politically daunting effort. And while this crisis has been brewing for years, it is now truly upon us.

We are used to seeing celebrities airbrushed to perfection but this weekend two fabulous famous females have spoken out about their normal bodies. Model Chrissy Teigen proudly showed off her stretch marks in an Instagram post that has been praised by her fans. And the singer Pink hit back at critics who fat shamed her for an outfit she wore to a recent charity event alongside her husband Carey Hart. Scroll down for video . Model Chrissy Teigen was praised this week as she posted a picture of herself to Instagram showing off her stretch marks . Chrissy's fans were happy that she shared the picture, with one of them commenting that 'real women' have stretch marks . Chrissy, 29, posted the picture of her thighs which had clear stretch marks on them saying: 'Bruises from bumping kitchen drawer handles for a week. Stretchies say hi!' She received praise from many fans, such as Instagram user @saraelizabef  who said: 'Love it! Real women have stretch marks #respect'. Another follower, @emmalittle5, commented: 'I have so much respect for you! I have stretchies too and I appreciate someone being real about them and acknowledging them thanks.' Meanwhile, Pink took to Twitter to speak out against those who had commented on her weight at an event she attended to support a doctor friend. She said: 'I can see that some of you are concerned about me from your comments about my weight. 'You’re referring to the pictures of me from last night’s cancer benefit that I attended to support my dear friend Dr Maggie DiNome. The singer Pink hit back at those who criticised her weight at an event recently, saying that she was happy with her body . In a message posted to her Twitter account Pink jokingly referred to herself as 'cheesecake' and said that she felt beautiful in her dress . She continued: 'She was given the Duke Award for her tireless efforts and stellar contributions to the eradication of cancer. But unfortunately, my weight seems much more important to some of you. 'While I admit that the dress didn’t photograph as well as it did in my kitchen, I will also admit that I felt very pretty. In fact, I feel beautiful. 'So, my good and concerned peoples, please don’t worry about me. I’m not worried about me. And I’m not worried about you either:)… . 'I am perfectly fine, perfectly happy, and my healthy, voluptuous and crazy strong body is having some much deserved time off. Thanks for your concern. Love, cheesecake.' And Chrissy and Pink aren't the first stars to make comments about their bodies or to be keen to show off their more natural selves. Kelly Clarkson recently gave an interview to Ellen DeGeneres in which she said that she was used to being bullied about her weight . Recently Kelly Clarkson gave an interview to American chat show host Ellen DeGeneres in which she discussed how she had been facing criticism for her weight for years. She said: 'I’m such a creative person that I yo yo. So sometimes I’m more fit and I get into kickboxing hardcore. And then sometimes I don’t and I’m like.. I’d rather have wine.' 'We are who we are. Whatever size,' Kelly told Ellen, prompting applause from the studio audience. 'You know, if it’s you, you’re just like whatever,' she said. 'I think what hurts my feelings..... is that I’ll have a meet and greet after the show and a girl who is, like, bigger than me will be in the meet and greet and be like, 'wow, if they think you’re big, I must be so fat to them.' In 2012 Girls star and producer Lena Dunham hit back after she was criticised for wearing a pair of short shorts on the red carpet. In 2012 Lena Dunham recieved harsh criticism for this outfit. She said she didn't think a thinner woman would have been criticised in the same way . Lena told her critics: 'I am going to live to be 100, and I am going to show my thighs every day till I die.' She said at the time: 'Last week I wore something to an event...a big top and little shorts, and a bunch of [blog posts] came out that I had been out without pants [trousers],' 'I actually saw it...'Love it or hate it: The no-pants look.' My mom...thought it was so funny. 'My boyfriend was like, 'People seem to be worked up about you going out without pants.' But I didn't go out without pants! I had shorts on.' Lena continued: 'If Olivia Wilde had gone to a party in...little shorts, she might have been on a 'weird dressed list' or been told her outfit was cute. 'I don't think a girl with tiny thighs would have received such no-pants attention. I think what it really was...'Why did you all make us look at your thighs?' 'My response is, get used to it because I am going to live to be 100, and I am going to show my thighs every day till I die.' Tyra Banks' weight has gone up and down over the years and the model says that anyone who doesn't like the way she looks can kiss her fat a** . Former supermodel Tyra Banks similarly hit back after she was subject to mean remarks about her fuller figure. She said: 'To all of you that have something nasty to say about me, or other women that are built like me, women that sometimes or all the time look like this, women whose names you know, women whose names you don't, women who have been picked on, women whose husbands put them down, women at work or girls in school — I have one thing to say to you. Kiss my fat a**!' In 2014 when she was criticised for her appearance at the Golden Globes actress Gabourey Sidibe had the perfect response to her haters. She said: 'To the people making mean comments about my [Golden Globes] pics, I mos def cried about it on that private jet on the way to my dream job last night #jk.'

Article:
Kent Sprouse acknowledged almost immediately after he was arrested more than a decade ago that he killed a police officer and another man outside a Dallas-area convenience store. A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. No new appeals are pending as Sprouse's lethal injection scheduled for Thursday evening approaches. He would be the fifth inmate executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row: Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) andcustomer  Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said a recent purchase of pentobarbital means they have enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho believes he is improving in every aspect of his job but insisted his one problem is that he cannot help but be truthful when he addresses the media.

Article:
The collapse in Roberto Mancini's relationship with Manchester City was rooted in his dismay at the quality of English players signed by the club. When names like Scott Sinclair, Jack Rodwell and to a lesser extent Adam Johnson were signed, he could barely disguise his contempt, feeling none of them would help him take on Barcelona and Real Madrid in the Champions League. 'Ask Marwood,' he would spit out when asked about the club's transfer policy, referring to the club's then-football administrator Brian Marwood who was responsible at the time for buying players. Tottenham defender Danny Rose has been linked with a move to Manchester City . Mancini was sacked in 2013 and nearly two years on, Marwood has a new role at the academy with a Spaniard, Txiki Begiristain, in his old job with the title director of football. And yet the dilemma remains the same: How do City buy enough top English players to fulfil quotas for homegrown players without breaking FPP (financial fair play) regulations again? It won't be easy and could explain why City – who have slumped to fourth in the league – are being linked with less glamorous names like Danny Rose and Aaron Cresswell. Good players certainly, but good enough? Probably not. It's a sobering thought that Rodwell made only seven Premier League starts in two seasons for City after a £12million move from Everton. Sinclair started just twice after signing from Swansea and is currently on loan at Aston Villa. Plenty of things at City have been carefully planned and executed well since the club's owners from Abu Dhabi took over in 2008. (From left) Manchester City director of football Txiki Begiristain, assistant manager Brian Kidd, manager Manuel Pellegrini and former football administrator Brian Marwood . The Etihad Campus is a glittering monument to football development and helping the community, while two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and Capital One Cup is an excellent trophy haul considering where the club have come from. But one weakness has been in their approach to having enough homegrown players, lagging behind most of their rivals. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger signed Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers and Manchester United bought Wayne Rooney, Phil Jones and Luke Shaw as teenagers. Most spectacularly, Liverpool bought players like Jordan Henderson, Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling and invested in making them better. Spurs have brought through Harry Kane and Ryan Mason from their academy. Only Chelsea face similar issues to City. Homegrown rules are complicated and differ slightly between competitions. Scott Sinclair (left) and Jack Rodwell are two English players who were bought by Manchester City . In the Premier League, you must have eight homegrown players if you fill your squad of 25. Homegrown players can be born overseas as long as they have been at a club's academy three years before the age of 21. If clubs can't find eight, they have to reduce their squad accordingly, as Chelsea have had to this season. Under 21 players can be named in the squad in addition to the 25. City's six Premier League homegrown players are: Joe Hart, Richard Wright, Dedryck Boyata, Gael Clichy, Frank Lampard and James Milner and there lies a major problem for next season. Lampard is definitely off and Milner is out of contract too. Clichy has endured a poor season and City will want a new left-back while Boyata, a Belgian who has been at City since he was 16, is not good enough to win a regular first-team place. The feeling is he was only offered his latest contract because he filled one of the homegrown slots. Ditto, third-choice goalkeeper Wright. Manchester United signed both Wayne Rooney (left) and Luke Shaw as teenagers . The Champions League squads of 25 also require eight players to have been trained in England, but four of those must have come through the ranks at City. Boyata was their only club-trained player named this season. It will be a major problem for the club next season as their one-season punishment (for breaching FFP rules) to name a squad of 21 is lifted and they can name 25 again. These will be issues exercising the minds at the very top of the club. But whichever way they look at it, City have three options which carry a downside: . 1) Spend big on the best English players 2) Find their own from their academy or 3) Buy cheaper English players who might not be good enough. Daniel Sturridge (left) and Jordan Henderson are two players Liverpool bought to boost their English quota . For option one, supply and demand is a problem. There are probably only three England players most people would call good international-class and therefore worthy of a place in the City team should they want to win titles at home and abroad. Hart is already there, Wayne Rooney is at Manchester United and presumably unattainable while Raheem Sterling would be a premium price. 'Can you get Sterling? Maybe if you go to Liverpool with £100million you can,' complained Manuel Pellegrini recently. No wonder City appear ready to open negotiations at £50m. Kean Bryan is one of the young players at Manchester City who is tipped to go on to big things . Midfielder Kean Bryan ticks all the boxes for what Manchester City hope to achieve in the future. A box-to-box midfielder from Manchester, he joined City at the age of 11 and has gone on to be an England youth international at different age levels. Aged 18, he has played for Patrick Vieira's under-21 elite development squad this season, and played five matches in City's run to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Youth League, a Champions League equivalent for under-20s. Been compared to Steven Gerrard. The last Mancunian to play regularly for City was Michael Johnson and he had to retire early after injury problems. Of the next generation, £60m has been quoted for Everton's Ross Barkley, a huge price for unproven talent. Harry Kane would be an interesting target as would Everton's Under21 defender John Stones, who might represent the best value-for-money. Jack Wilshere has had injury problems. City's academy cost £200m but so far none has broken into the first-team squad regularly. Marcos Lopes is on loan at Lille and may move there permanently. Karim Rekik has played Champions League football for PSV. City will hope starlets like Jose Pozo, Thierry Ambrose, Mathias Bossaerts, Seko Fofana, Jason Denayer and Kean Bryan will become their homegrown first-teamers of the future, but they are unlikely to make a major contribution next season. Bryan is novel and interesting, he is from Manchester and has been likened to Steven Gerrard. Ross Barkley is one of the most hotly tipped players in England and worth in the region of £60m . The third option is to try and sign any English Premier League player who is available. It might not be the best idea for the players themselves, Johnson said after he was sold to Sunderland that the move to City can turn sour for young players. 'It is a lot different when you don't play. The novelty wears off, definitely,' he said. Rodwell is now at Sunderland too, while Sinclair will make his loan move to Aston Villa permanent provided they stay up. Rose and Cresswell be warned. Making up the numbers at Manchester City doesn't necessarily help the player or club. PREMIER LEAGUE . Eight players in the 25-man squads must be homegrown. A player counts as homegrown if they have spent three years at an English club up to the age of 21. Squads can be supplemented by as many Under 21 players as clubs want. CHAMPIONS LEAGUE . Eight of the 25-man squad must be homegrown, four of whom must be club-trained ie have come through the ranks of the actual club they are playing for. Squads can be supplemented by Under-21 players provided they have been with the club for at least two years. SERIE A . From 2016, squads will be limited to 25 players (not counting Under 21s), four of whom have to have grown up in Italy and four of whom have to be products of their club's academy, similar to Champions League rules. Clubs are not allowed to sign more than two non-EU players in a season. LA LIGA . Clubs are not allowed more than three non-EU players in their squads of 25, or in matches. However, after five years, you can apply for Spanish citizenship and become an EU player, as Lionel Messi has done. There are no additional homegrown rules for EU players. BUNDESLIGA . Clubs need to include eight homegrown players, including four from their own youth academy, in their squad. But unlike the Premier League, squads aren't restricted to 25 players so they can still sign as many non-homegrown players as they like. There are no restrictions on signing non-EU players. MANCHESTER CITY . Association-trained homegrown players: Joe Hart, Richard Wright, Gael Clichy, James Milner, Frank Lampard. Club-trained homegrown player: Dedryck Boyata .

Added Entity: Roberto Mancini's dissatisfaction
Summary 1: Roberto Mancini, former Manchester City manager, was dissatisfied with the quality of English players signed by the club. He felt players like Scott Sinclair and Jack Rodwell weren't good enough to compete against teams like Barcelona and Real Madrid. Mancini's relationship with the club deteriorated, leading to his dismissal in 2013. The club now faces the challenge of acquiring top English players to meet homegrown quotas without violating financial fair play regulations.

Added Entity: Brian Marwood's role
Summary 2: Mancini's dissatisfaction was directed at Brian Marwood, then-football administrator responsible for player acquisitions. Marwood now works at the academy, replaced by Txiki Begiristain as director of football. Despite the change, City still struggles to buy top English players to meet homegrown quotas without breaching financial fair play rules. Mancini's dismissal in 2013 was partly due to his discontent with English signings like Sinclair and Rodwell.

Added Entity: Homegrown player rules
Summary 3: City's challenge lies in meeting homegrown player rules without violating financial fair play regulations. These rules require eight homegrown players in a 25-man squad.

Added Entity: Potential player acquisitions
Summary 5: City's potential acquisitions include Danny Rose and Aaron Cresswell, as they struggle to meet homegrown player rules without violating financial fair play regulations. Their current homegrown players include Hart, Wright, Clichy, Lampard, and Milner. Mancini's 2013 dismissal was partly due to his dissatisfaction with English signings like Sinclair and Rodwell, overseen by then-football administrator Marwood, now at the academy.

Baseline length_test: Roberto Mancini's relationship with Manchester City collapsed due to his dissatisfaction with the quality of English players signed by the club. The club's struggle to buy top English players without breaching financial fair play regulations continues. This issue could explain why City is being linked with less glamorous names like Danny Rose and Aaron Cresswell. The club's approach to having enough homegrown players has been a weakness.

Jordan Speith is in prime position to win the Masters, maintaining the lead during the final round at Augusta. The 21-year-old has begun the last day of the hallowed tournament after setting a scoring record for 54 holes of 16 under par. He is playing alongside British contender Justin Rose in the final, showcase pairing, and will be looking to avoid the disappointment of last year, when he finished runner-up. Some of his American rivals, such as Tiger Woods, have slipped down the leaderboard. But others, including Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson are still posing a threat. Jordan Speith, pictured during his final round on Sunday, is in prime position to win The Masters, taking a four shot lead into the final round at Augusta . He is playing with British contender Justin Rose, who began the day four shots off the pace . Spieth, who squandered a front-nine Masters lead on Sunday last year and settled for sharing second behind Bubba Watson, is the man to beat for the top prize of $1.8 million at the $10 million event. 'Last year definitely left a bad taste in my mouth,' Spieth said. 'Looking at trying to get some revenge. I've got a long way to go still.' The spotlight belonged to Spieth, who could break Tiger Woods' 1997 tournament record of 18-under 270 by shooting 69 in the final round. The former world number one Woods started the day some shots back, and caused concern on the 7th hole when he seemed to injure his finger. He then pulled up on the 8th tee, shaking off the same hand while his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn watched from the crowds. If he wins, Spieth would become the second-youngest winner in Masters history, five months older than Woods when he won his first major in 1997. Spieth could also become only the fifth wire-to-wire winner in Masters history, joining Craig Wood in 1941, Arnold Palmer in 1960, Jack Nicklaus in 1972 and Ray Floyud in 1976. Spieth is the first player since Greg Norman in 1996 to own the outright Masters lead after each of the first three rounds, but Norman squandered a six-stroke lead in making the greatest last-day collapse in major golf history and lost by five to Nick Faldo. Tiger Woods  waits to play a shot on the first hole during the final round. He started the day further down the field looking to make up lost ground . The former world number one let go of his club and shook his hand after hurting his wrist during after playing a shot in pine needles . His girlfriend, gold medal skier Lindsey Vonn, was spotted walking up the first way as he got his round underway . She has been on hand to support her beau at Augusta throughout the week . No player in Masters history has ever reached 19-under at any stage of the tournament but Spieth flirted with it Saturday, making four birdies in five holes to stand 18-under before a double bogey at 17 and a 10-foot par save at 18, and could threaten again Sunday. With 22 birdies through 54 holes, Spieth broke Woods' record of 21 in 2005 and is on pace to shatter Mickelson's Masters 72-hole birdie total record of 25 from 2001. But Spieth has not made the Masters a runaway. Rose, who closed with five birdies in the last six holes Saturday, is trying for a second major crown - 22 months after his breakthrough at Merion. And Mickelson is still in position to potentially become the second-oldest winner in Masters history after Jack Nicklaus, who was 46 when he won in 1986. Mickelson has only one top-10 in his past 31 starts but it was a runner-up effort at last year's PGA Championship. Mickelson won the 2004, 2006 and 2010 Masters, as well as the 2005 PGA Championship and 2013 British Open. Should he win Sunday, he would match Faldo and Lee Trevino as six-time major champions. Spieth (above with girlfriend Annie Verret on her 21st birthday) is the first player since Greg Norman in 1996 to own the outright Masters lead after each of the first three rounds . On Saturday it was reported that the Dallas, Texas native has just bought $2.3million on a stunning Texas mansion and has a gorgeous girlfriend, Annie Verret, who also happens to be his high school sweetheart. Spieth grew up the oldest of three siblings to Shawn and Chris Spieth. Steven, Spieth's younger brother, is an athlete as well, and plays basketball for Brown University. Then there is his youngest sibling Ellie, who was born with a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum, and who has played the biggest role in shaping her brother's career according to Spieth's mother. She says Ellie helps the young superstar stay so grounded. 'Jordan wouldn't be where he's at today if he didn't grow up with Ellie,' said Mrs. Spieth in an interview with ESPN. 'Jordan realizes this isn't real life at the Masters. Trying to sit around and have dinner when his sister doesn't want to eat when everybody else is eating and has a fit, that's real life.' Spieth on his own website has said: 'Being Ellie's brother humbles me every day of my life.'

Fighter ace: Douglas Bader's story is to be told in a Hollywood film dubbed ‘The First Great Escape’ The story of how Douglas Bader recovered from having both legs amputated to become one of Britain’s greatest fighter aces is remarkable enough. But now another astonishing but little-known chapter of his war career is to be told in a Hollywood film being dubbed ‘The First Great Escape’. Bader – who lost his legs in a flying accident in 1931 – was shot down over France in August 1941 and ended up in a German prison camp in Warburg. It was there that the officer, who always made light of his disability and refused to even use a stick, was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough. Bader’s life story has already been the subject of the successful film Reach for the Sky in 1956 starring Kenneth More. This latest look at his exploits is based on a book on the Warburg escape by historian Mark Felton called Zero Night. It was a plot hatched by Scottish lieutenant Jock Hamilton-Baillie, 23, and involved build folding ladders to escape over the wire. Major Tom Stallard, of the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. The fighter ace went on to describe it as ‘the most brilliant escape conception of this war’. The ladders were made from wood from a wrecked hut and crafted in the camp’s music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. They were disguised as bookshelves. On the night of the break – August 30, 1942 – the prisoners managed to fuse the camp’s search lights and 41 men carrying four 12ft scaling ladders rushed the fence. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the wire, of which three made a ‘home run’ back to freedom. The Great Escape: Bader's story predates the break in 1944 immortalised in the film starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough (pictured) Bader was among those recaptured but was such a nuisance to the Germans that he ended up in the ‘escape-proof’ Colditz Castle and remained in captivity until the end of the war. More than 40 Allied prisoners put their lives on the line in a plot to escape from Oflag VI-B camp near Warburg, Germany, in 1942. Major Tom Stallard, a larger than life 37-year-old from Somerset captured while serving in the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. While the Great Escape relied on its famous tunnels, the Warburg mass break out saw the men boldly leap over the huge perimeter fences using wooden ladders. Bader described what happened as 'the most brilliant escape conception of this war'. Months of meticulous planning and secret training went into the three minute charge of the camp's double perimeter fences. Bader’s life story has been the subject of 1956 film Reach for the Sky starring Kenneth More (pictured) A series of makeshift ladders propped against the prison camp's perimeter fence were made from wood plundered from a wrecked hut. They were crafted in the camp's music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. The escape was codenamed Operation Olympian because it involved troops from across the Commonwealth - Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The rights to Dr Felton’s book (pictured) have been bought by production firm Essential 11 USA . As the night of the breakout loomed, the ladders were disguised as bookshelves to fool the guards. After the prisoners fused the perimeter search lights, 41 of them carrying four 12-foot scaling ladders made from bed slats rushed to the barbed-wire fence and clambered over. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the barbed wire, of which three made a 'home run' back to freedom. Bader later ended up in Colditz and had his tin legs taken away to ensure he remained in captivity until the end of the war. Major Stallard and another leading light of the escape Major Johnnie Cousens, also of the Durham Light Infantry, survived the war and lived into their 70s. Both were too modest to breathe hardly a word about what had happened on August 30 1942. But now their story could trump the Great Escape after Hollywood bosses snapped up the rights to turn military historian Mark Felton's book about the escape Zero Night into a blockbuster. The rights to Dr Felton’s book have been bought by the makers of 2013’s Saving Mr Banks with Tom Hanks. Production firm Essential 11 USA, the makers of the 2013 Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson hit Saving Mr Banks, is now working on a script. Dr Felton said a number of 'A-list' Hollywood stars were queuing up for roles and Essential 11 had invited him to help cast the leads, although he could not reveal who was interested. He said: 'I'm very, very pleased. It's very, very exciting. Essential 11 did a fantastic job with Saving Mr Banks and to have that same team working on this is very pleasing.'

A dog who was living in a shelter for the past five years has finally gone home to a loving family in New York state after his photo was shared on social media. Chester, a 6-year-old Pit Bull mix, had been housed at the North Fork Animal Welfare League on Long Island. The poor pooch had been living in New York state shelters since 2010 and it looked as though things were going to remain that way, until a picture that was shared online garnered sympathy from across the country. Scroll down for video . How could you say no? This is the picture that secured Chester a loving home . Long-time coming: Chester, a six-year-old pit bull, was found as a stray and had been living in shelters for the past five years . Welcome to the family: On Friday morning, Dana Dor, her husband Adi, and their boys, Aidan and Brandon, headed from their Lake Ronkonkoma home to meet Chester . The shelter, which is based in Riverhead on Long Island posted a picture on Thursday that was hard for dog-lovers to resist. It showed Chester with a sign around his neck. An image that was clearly designed to tug at the heartstrings of dog-lovers. 'Why doesn't anybody want me? I've been waiting 5 years. Everyone at the shelter tells me what a good boy I am. So why has no one adopted me? I promised to be good and love my new family. Please maybe you are my new family/ I sit and wait for you to come,' the message pleaded. The picture was shared more than 6,000 times and inquires about adopting Chester poured in from all over the world. 'It was crazy. I posted the original photo on the League's Facebook page and by later that day there were over 6000 shares,' NFAWL manager Gabby Stroup said. 'There were more phone calls then I can count; the phone just never stopped. People called from Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Michigan, Oregon, New Jersey Wisconsin, Nova Scotia, Australia and more — people were tearing up as they called.' Tugging at heartstrings: Staring with his sad puppy dog eyes into the camera, Chester sat with a paw draped over a sign which read: 'Why doesn't anybody want me? Saying goodbye: Saturday morning, volunteers came to the shelter to say good-bye to Chester, a longtime favorite among those who'd come regularly to walk him and give him belly rubs and kisses . Within a couple of days of the posting, Chester was adopted by a family with two sons from New York. They came to take him home on Saturday. 'A woman named Dana called me inquiring about him; a friend of hers from Michigan had shared Chester's picture on her page,' Ms Stroup said. 'Dana and I talked about Chester for a bit; she wanted to talk it over with her family.' On Friday morning, Dana Dor, her husband Adi, and their boys, Aidan and Brandon, headed from their Lake Ronkonkoma home  to meet Chester. 'They came and met him and it is just a perfect match,' Stroup said to Southold Local.com . 'It was by far the most amazing thing I have ever seen — the amount of people who shared and called or emailed was amazing. This was one of the happiest days,' Ms Stroup said. Yesterday morning, volunteers came to the shelter to say good-bye to Chester. After five years, he had become a longtime favorite among those who'd come regularly to walk him. So happy together: Dana Dor said the family lost two Yorkies, five years ago, the same amount of time that Chester has been waiting for his forever family. 'We think he was waiting for us,' Mrs Dor said . Part of the family: Adi Dor sets up a cage for Chester to sleep in at his new home . Settling in: Chester had found his perfect match in the Dor family and was soon taken for a new life at their Lake Ronkonkoma home . The Dors arrived and Chester seemed to like the family instantly, covering their faces with licks and kisses. 'We saw him and we felt connected. It was meant to be, ' Adi Dor said; his wife said her husband had tears in his eyes the first time he met Chester. Their two young boys were delighted with the new addition to their family. They had been asking for a dog for some time. Ms Stroup said it was all down to the power of Facebook and the pleading message that hung around Chester's neck. The shelter has received a lot of attention as a result of Chester's plight and intends to use it's Facebook page to help other long-term residents of the refuge find new homes. Puppy power: Using the power of social media the animal shelter took a picture of the poor pooch and posted it onto a Facebook page where it received 6,000 likes and Chester found a loving home .
