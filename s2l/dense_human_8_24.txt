This is the chilling message a mother wrote on Facebook a day after allegedly abandoning her quadriplegic 21-year-old son in the Pennsylvania woods with just a blanket and a bible. 'I'm so happy,' Nyia Parler, 41, commented under a new picture of her cuddling her boyfriend on Tuesday. Just 24 hours earlier, police say she wheeled her care-dependent son into a park near their home in south west Philadelphia and left him there, before going to stay with her partner in Maryland. Relatives, who had been contacted by the boy's school when he didn't turn up to class on Tuesday, commented on Parler's picture, 'nyia call me asap,' and 'How the hell you happy?!? Call me!' On Sunday police said that Parler will be arrested as soon as she is released from hospital herself. Parler was admitted to a Maryland facility on Sunday for an 'undisclosed condition' and faces charges including aggravated assault, reckless endangering, neglect of a care-dependent person, kidnapping, unlawful restraint and false imprisonment, according to police in Pennsylvania. 'When her treatment is completed, we will take her to court and she can either waive or fight extradition,' Capt. Paul Starks of the Montgomery County, Maryland, police said in a statement. Chilling: This is the message Nyia Parler wrote on Facebook hours after she allegedly left her quadriplegic son alone in woodland with just a blanket and a bible. Relatives contacted by the boy's school frantically replied . Charged: Parler (right) was detained in Maryland on Saturday night, charged with assault and neglect. Police say she left her son on Monday to visit her boyfriend John Ferguson (left) in Montgomery County, Maryland . Horrific: The quadriplegic man was found here on the floor of a secluded woodland outside Philadelphia with this Bible and this blanket, 10 feet from his wheelchair. He'd allegedly been left there by his mother five days earlier . Parler left her son — who also has cerebral palsy — lying in leaves and covered with a blanket next to a wheelchair while she left town on a romantic getaway with her new boyfriend, John Ferguson, police said. He was found on Friday night near Cobbs Creek Park. Police believe he had been there for five days and the last time he and his mother were seen together was on Easter Sunday. She then boarded a bus to bisit Ferguson in Maryland, said Lt. John Walker of the Southwest Detectives Division. Walker said the victim was found around the corner from their home, and he described the scenario authorities believe to have taken place: 'She pushes him about 150 yards from the highway into the wooded area, takes him out of wheelchair, lays him on the ground, puts a blanket over him and leaves a Bible with him, and then just walks away.' During the period he was exposed to the elements, the young man was 'completely defenseless' in an area with wild animals, with no water and in cold, damp weather, Walker said. 'It's only by the grace of God that he survived this. Amazing,' he said. Reports claim relatives have been trying to obtain guardianship of the boy from Parler (pictured) for years . Contacted in Maryland after the young man's school became concerned about her absence, the victim's mother told relatives and authorities that he was with her, Walker said. 'Obviously her statements made during the week were not truthful,' he said. Her boyfriend, however, assumed other relatives were caring for the young man and 'was in shock when he learned what happened,' Walker said. A 16-year-old son also residing with the family is now in the care of other family relatives, Walker added. Walker said the son was hospitalized with dehydration, malnutrition, a deep cut on his back that caused concern about potential infection and possible eye injuries, but he appeared to be improving. 'He seemed to be a little happier yesterday,' Walker said. 'You could tell he knew his family was around and felt more comfortable. The 21-year-old, who is non-verbal and suffers from cerebral palsy, is now in Philadelphia Children's Hospital with his aunts, where he is being treated for dehydration and cuts to his back and eyes. Officials told NBC Philadelphia her son would have died if he hadn't been spotted by people walking along a nearby street. 'This kid is obviously a fighter. It's just unbelievable how we found him last night. It's just heartbreaking to see how another human, especially a mother, could treat him like that,' Lt. Walker of Philadelphia Police told ABC. Abandoned: A passerby noticed the 21-year-old here in a wooded Philadelphia park . The son was hospitalized with dehydration, malnutrition, a cut to his back and eye injuries. According to Philly.com two of his aunts, who are with him in hospital, have been trying to obtain guardianship for years. A neighbor, who declined to be identified, told DailyMail.com: 'She used to push him out to the school bus in his wheelchair, she seemed to care for him. Whenever I saw him, I saw her.' Another, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I would see them outside together in the summer when he got home from school. Nothing looked wrong, I didn't suspect anything.' Walker said the son was exposed to the elements and other dangers. 'A lot of things could have happened out there,' he said. 'Obviously he's in the middle of a wooded area. You have wild animals there ... this kid could not defend himself. He does not function at all.' Walker added : 'What we've learned so far is that the 21-year-old child lives with his mother, completely dependent on mom as a result of his condition. 'She also has a 16-year-old son who is staying with other family members. 'We know she left for Maryland on Monday to go see her boyfriend on a bus.' The man had been reported missing from class at Philadelphia's School Of The Future on Monday. However, when a teacher called Parler she told them they were both in Maryland and he was well. Rescuers used flashlights to find the non-verbal in the East Lansdowne area of Philadelphia on Friday night . Investigation: Police arrested the man's 41-year-old mother, who left him alone in the park on Monday morning to visit her boyfriend in Maryland. Officers recovered the man's wheelchair (pictured) for evidence .

Article:
Michael Carrick's outstanding second-half performance for England against Italy on Tuesday night has put him on course to become the longest-serving outfield player to represent the Three Lions behind Sir Stanley Matthews. Carrick made his England debut against Mexico in May 2001 as a teenager with West Ham United and if – as now seems likely – he carries through to Euro 2016, he will be the first non-goalkeeper since the legendary Sir Stanley to have an international career spanning more than 15 years. Matthews won his 54 England caps over a 23-year period between 1934 and 1957, interrupted of course by the Second World War. Michael Carrick's appearance for England against Italy on Tuesday night keeps him in the longest-serving list . Carrick has played for England for 13 years, 310 days - while Sir Stanley Matthews reached 22 years, 228 days . Sir Stanley runs with the ball in action for England against Brazil at Wembley in an international friendly . Stanley Matthews (1934-57) 22 yrs, 228 days . Peter Shilton (1970-90) 19 yrs, 224 days . Frank Lampard (1999-2014) 14 yrs, 257 days . Steven Gerrard (2000-2014) 14 yrs, 23 days . David Seaman (1988-2002) 13 yrs, 335 days . Michael Carrick (2001- ) 13 yrs, 310 days . ...AND THE LEGENDS HE OVERTOOK . David Beckham (1996-2009) – 13 yrs, 43 days . Sir Bobby Charlton (1958-70) 12 yrs, 23 days . Bobby Moore (1962-73) 11 yrs, 178 days . Gary Lineker (1984-1992) 8 yrs, 22 days . Carrick was hailed by Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney as 'the best player on the pitch by a mile' after the 33-year-old was introduced as a half-time substitute in Turin and helped Roy Hodgson's men fight back to earn a 1-1 draw. His longevity already surpasses that of great names like Sir Bobby Charlton, Bobby Moore, David Beckham and Gary Lineker and if he continues to play in the next European Championship he will overtake Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard too. The only player to have had a longer career since Matthews is goalkeeper Peter Shilton who played for England between 1971 and 1990. It also begs the question why Carrick, who has won four Premier League titles and the Champions League with Manchester United, has been used so sparingly by his country at international tournaments. He played once at the 2006 World Cup in a 1-0 victory against Ecuador, was in the squad but never played by Fabio Capello in the disastrous 2010 campaign in South Africa, and wasn't even selected by Roy Hodgson last year in Brazil, even though England's perennial problem has been keeping the ball. With Rooney now captain and clearly a huge fan of the midfielder, it seems unlikely Carrick will be overlooked again and is now finally getting the recognition he deserves. The 33-year-old may still have a few years left but remains a long way off Sir Stanley's record . Carrick (left) pictured with England team-mates Raheem Sterling (centre) and Danny Welbeck (right) vs Italy, March 31, 2015 . vs Lithuania, Mar 27, 2015 . vs Poland, October 15, 2013 . vs Montenegro, October 11, 2013 . vs Brazil, June 2, 2013 . vs Ireland, May 29, 2013 . vs Montenegro, March 26, 2013 . vs Poland, October 17, 2012 . vs San Marino, October 12, 2012 . vs Moldova, September 12, 2012 . vs Italy, August 15, 2012 . vs Mexico, May 24, 2010 . vs Egypt, March 3, 2010 . vs Ukraine, October 10, 2009 . vs Slovenia, September 5, 2009 . vs Holland, August 12, 2009 . vs Slovakia, March 28, 2009 . vs Spain, February 11, 2009 . vs Germany, November 19, 2008 . vs Germany, August 22, 2007 . vs Brazil, June 1, 2007 . vs Spain, February 7, 2007 . vs Holland, November 15, 2006 . vs Croatia, October 11, 2006 . vs Macedonia, October 7, 2006 . vs Macedonia, September 6, 2006 . vs Ecuador, June 25, 2006 . vs Jamaica, June 3, 2006 . vs Uruguay, March 1, 2006 . vs Colombia, May 31, 2005 . vs USA, May 28, 2005 . vs Holland, August 15, 2001 . vs Mexico, May 25, 2001 .

Summary 1: This article discusses the impressive performance of Michael Carrick, an English footballer, in a recent match against Italy. His performance has led to speculation that he may become the longest-serving outfield player for England, a record currently held by Sir Stanley Matthews. Carrick's career with England began in 2001 and if he continues to play until Euro 2016, he will have had an international career spanning over 15 years.

Summary 2: Michael Carrick, a Manchester United player, is nearing the record of longest-serving outfield player for England, currently held by Sir Stanley Matthews. If he plays until Euro 2016, he will surpass the career span of Peter Shilton, another record holder. Carrick's performance has been praised by teammate Wayne Rooney.

Summary 3: Manchester United's Michael Carrick, praised by Wayne Rooney, is nearing Sir Stanley Matthews' record as England's longest-serving outfield player. If he plays until Euro 2016, he'll surpass Peter Shilton's career span. Despite his performance, Carrick's use in international tournaments, like the 2006 World Cup under Fabio Capello, has been limited by coach Roy Hodgson.

Summary 4: Michael Carrick, who began his international career with England in 2001 while at West Ham United, is on track to become the longest-serving outfield player for the national team, a record held by Sir Stanley Matthews. If Carrick plays until Euro 2016, his international career will span over 15 years, nearing Matthews' 54 England caps earned over a 23-year period.

Article:
A woman's noisy neighbour has issued a withering reply to her hand-written letter complaining about his hard-partying ways, claiming only the deaf and 'those buried in the cemetery' would have any concerns with the noise coming for his home. The man's sarcastic response comes after Melbourne-based actor, Lucy Gransbury, wrote a two-page rant claiming her neighbours were keeping her awake at night. Gransbury thought the good-humoured note worked wonders after an entire week of uninterrupted sleep until she was woken again just before dawn the following Sunday. So she followed up by dropping a thank-you card and some gifts over the fence to the seven or eight men who lived there because she was 'too scared' to knock on their door. But after a month of not hearing back from any of her boisterous neighbours, Jershon Witehira posted an equally cheeky reply on his Facebook page opening with ' My dearest Lucy'. Scroll down for video . After weeks of not hearing back from any of the boisterous lads, Jershon Witehira posted an equally cheeky reply on his Facebook page opening with this photo holding her two handwritten notes . Witehira said although others may find her crazy he thinks Gransbury is brave and creative . 'I'm impressed by the lengths you went to creatively to get your point across and even more by the audience it reached,' he said. He went onto apologise for the the' music festivals and comedy galas' and added that the deaf man and those buried in the cemetery 4kms away, that Gransbury had referred to, awake occasionally. 'There's probably people out there that think your crazy for what you done but not me I thought you were brave and I respect you for it,' he went on to say. He then took up Gransbury's offer of getting to know each other over a few drinks. 'We look forward to getting to know you also and about that G&T you mentioned let's do it.' But he saved the most hilarious comment for the end. ‪'P.S We have a room for rent if you know anyone interested. P.P.S I'm deadly serious.' Lucy Gransbury dropped a thank you letter and gifts over the fence to her neighbours because she was too scared to knock on their door after they had been quiet for an entire week . The good-humoured letter asks the seven or eight burly blokes not to throw a hand grenade over her fence . Although a week after her first letter the neighbours woke her at 4.30am when they arrived home, and again at 6.45am when their mates left, Gransbury decided after writing a list of pros and cons that the mostly-reformed dudes, who she fears could crush her 'between their shoulder blades' as 'they seem to be a gang', deserved to be rewarded. The note, which was posted on her blog and on the Mamamia site, began with thanking the less-noisy neighbours for a quieter week and although their voices woke her on Sunday she was grateful there wasn't the 'bass guitar song' interrupting her dreams about Prince Harry. 'You probably think I'm a bit weird and have too much spare time, and you are entirely correct.' The gifts included: . A burnt DVD of the pilot episode of Neighbours where Max Ramsay breaks up a party on his namesake street by 'yelling at the flamin' lot of them'. She then later reveals that the DVD is in fact blank and suggests they watch the scene on YouTube. Two chickpea cans with a piece of string so she can create her 'own old-school walkie-talkie' with them while adding that they must detach the string if they are having a party - not to mention remove the chickpeas for a more effective communciation device. And in good neighbourly fashion - specifically chose chickpeas in case the burly blokes wanted to whip up some hummus for their next party. Last but certainly not least - Gransbury threw in some salt and vinegar chips because she wanted to share her favourite things with her dear neighbours. She signed off by saying she hoped they got a giggle out of her note instead of being insulted and throwing a hand grenade over her fence. One of the gifts was two cans and string so they could she can create her 'own old-school walkie-talkie' with her neighbours - and she chose chickpeas so they could also whip up some hummus for their next party . After she was woken by their voices on Sunday morning, she wrote pros and cons about the incident - Derpa is in reference to the man she used to regularly hear who sounded like he was constantly yelling 'derpa" Gransbury took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the first lengthy and hilarious handwritten letter over their adjoining back fence before running off in hysterics. She posted the letter on her blog with the precursor: 'So if you never hear from me again, I've been kidnapped and forcibly trapped in my neighbours' sound system.' Gransbury chose to replace the expletives she had the strong urge to use with the more polite neighbourly word of 'funk' in her letter that was also published on Mamamia website. 'Dear Noisy Neighbours, . 'There are some choice swear words I would like to throw at you, but in the interest of being neighbourly, I'm going to replace them all with the word 'funk'. 'Please turn your funking music down so I can get some funking sleep,' the letter opened with. Lucy Gransbury wrote a lengthy and quite hilarious handwritten letter to her noisy neighbours after enduring four months of sleepless nights due to their incessantly wild nocturnal ways . The actor/comedian used her humour in the two-page rant to get her rage across to the party-hard residents who live next door and cause her never-ending grief . Gransbury even took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the note over their adjoining fence before running off in hysterics . She then went onto say that she had been living for the past four months next to the culprits and was woken up by them 'all the funking time'. Adding that the night before she wrote the letter when was woken at 4.30am was an uncivilised time that should only be reserved for 'breakfast radio hosts, international flight passengers, and parents of infants.' Gransbury said she wanted to yell out to them at 5am but wouldn't have been heard over the revving of their friend's engine of their 'sh*thouse fancy ute.' 'They were then reversing down your driveway for so long and with such difficulty, that I am worried that the man behind the wheel was: A) drink driving B) not sure how to drive C) brain damaged D) actually a potato.' She signed off with her Twitter handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just 'head towards the loud house and turn left' Her hopes of the music stopping were quickly dashed as she continued to hear one note on the bass guitar 'over and funking over.' 'I'm not sure if it's you, or perhaps a friend, but one man seemed to contribute to the party by yelling 'derpa, derpa, derpa, derpa' at the top of his lungs. Is he okay?' she asked sarcastically. She expressed concern that this man is either not sure how to be human, brain damaged or simply a moron. The music was finally turned down at 6am - just two hours before Gransbury had to go out and begin her day. 'Everyone in my street probably feels the same. And the street behind us. And the deaf man in the next suburb. And anyone buried in the cemetery four kilometres away.' She also gave her neighbours two gifts - a pair of headphones and a CD she compiled herself with apt songs but then revealed that the CD was actually blank because she was 'too funking tired' to burn the songs . Gransbury said she bought this card because 'Shut The F**k Up' was not available in a large size . As the considerate neighbour, Gransbury gave her next door pals two gifts - a pair of headphones and a CD she compiled herself with the apt songs: Respect by Aretha Franklin, 'Wake Me Up' by Avicii, 'All About The Bass' by Meghan Trainor, 'Stop Right Now' by The Spice Girls and Uptown Funk' by Bruno Mars 'because it's just a funkin' good song, really'. But she later revealed in the note that the CD was actually blank because she was 'too funking tired' to burn the songs. After suggesting to catch up over a G&T sometime, she asked them to 'Grow up. Get some funking manners. And Go. The Funk. To Sleep.' Gransbury also warned them that she would call the police if there was a next time. The exhausted performer signed off with her Twitter handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just 'head towards the loud house and turn left'. After suggesting to catch up over a G&T sometime, the exhausted performer asked them to 'Grow up. Get some funking manners. And Go. The Funk. To Sleep'

Washington (CNN)One former employee of the private Blackwater Worldwide security company was sentenced Monday to life in prison and three others to 30 years each behind bars for their roles in a 2007 mass shooting in Baghdad that left 17 people dead. A federal jury convicted the four in October after a lengthy trial that saw some 30 witnesses travel from Iraq to testify against the security contractors. Prosecutors accused the men of illegally unleashed "powerful sniper fire, machine guns and grenade launchers on innocent men, women and children." Senior U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth sentenced Blackwater sniper Nicholas Slatten to a term of life in prison, mandatory for his first-degree murder conviction. Blackwater workers Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard were sentenced to 30 year each, plus one day. Slough was convicted of 13 counts of voluntary manslaughter, 17 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. The jury convicted Liberty of eight counts of voluntary manslaughter, 12 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. Heard was found guilty of six counts of voluntary manslaughter, 11 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. According to prosecutors, the four were among seven Blackwater employees who opened fire in the Nusoor Square traffic circle in Baghdad, killing 17 people. An FBI investigation found 14 of the deaths unjustified, according to rules of engagement for private security contractors in Iraq. Slatten was accused of firing the first shots. Survivors of shooting tell FBI their stories in 2007 . Blackwater said its convoy came under attack, and defense attorneys said in court that witness accounts were fabricated. But witnesses testified that the contractors opened fire without provocation. "It was horror," said Hasan Jaber, an attorney who was driving to work when he was shot three times. "People running out of their cars were being shot at. ... Anything that moved in Nusoor Square was shot. Women, children, young people, they shot everyone." Among the dead were two boys, 9 and 11, a doctor, a used car salesman, a truck driver, a businessman, an Iraqi soldier, a gardener, a taxi driver and an aspiring doctor taking his mother to an appointment, according to prosecutors. The parents and brothers of the 9-year-old victim were present in court during the sentencing hearing and spoke. Ali Razzaq's father looked at the defendants and yelled in broken English: "If I kill anyone in his family, what he do?! Today, we will see who will win, the law or Blackwater," he said. "Blackwater killed my son." Dad in 2007: Blackwater blew up son's and wife's 'skulls' The defense presented character witnesses, family members and former colleagues who testified to the defendants' capacity to work under fire and willingness to help others. Each defendant also gave a closing statement. Slatten addressed the court last, taking the opportunity to declare his innocence. Lamberth rejected his argument. The judge said that the punishments reflected the seriousness of the crimes. He said that the U.S. government "should be commended for finding and exposing the truth of what happened." Blackwater incident witness in 2007: 'It was hell' A few gasps were heard in the courtroom, and some crying. The case was initially dismissed in 2008 after a judge found the Justice Department withheld key evidence and violated the rights of the contractors. A federal appeals court reversed the ruling, paving the way for the two-month trial that ended in convictions for the four. Another contractor, Jeremy Ridgeway, pleaded guilty in 2008 to voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter and testified for the government. He has not yet been sentenced. Blackwater lost its $1 billion contract with the State Department to protect American diplomatic personnel in 2009, after the Iraqi government refused to renew the company's operating license. The company was later renamed and sold, and now operates as ACADEMI, providing protection services and training. 2007 congressional report: Blackwater most often shoots first .

They've steamrolled past top-four rivals Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City in their current six-game Premier League winning streak, and Manchester United are looking to make it seventh heaven when they travel to table-toppers Chelsea on Saturday. Ahead of the blockbuster clash at Stamford Bridge, the United squad were pictured travelling down to London on Friday afternoon. Led by captain Wayne Rooney the Red Devils' contingent commuted via Stockport Railway Station to the English capital. Wayne Rooney (left) and Ashley Young were among the Manchester United stars who made the trip to London via train on Friday ahead of this weekend's Premier League clash at Chelsea . Radamel Falcao (left) or Robin van Persie (right) could start up front for United vs Chelsea on Saturday . United boss Louis van Gaal  faces a number of selection dilemmas ahead of their clash against the Blues . It was earlier revealed that the 29-year-old striker may have to revert to a midfield role against the Blues after Michael Carrick and Daley Blind were two of four  United players ruled out of the clash due to injury. However, Van Gaal is able to call upon the services of in-form midfielder Juan Mata who is returning to the home of his former club for the first time on Saturday. Mata, who won three trophies in two-and-a-half successful seasons at the Bridge, posted a picture via his Instagram account as the United players boarded the train on Friday afternoon. Accompanied with the caption: 'I got back to London a few times, but this one it's different... Big game, lots of memories, great day of football!... #CFC vs #MUFC' United's No 8 was all smiles as he gears up for what promises to be emotional return to west London. Alongside the injuries of Carrick and Blind, United duo Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo were also absent from the train ride - with the quartet all suffering injuries following United's 4-2 win over bitter rivals Manchester City on April 12. The club's injury setback means that Luke Shaw and Radamel Falcao could both be recalled against Jose Mourinho’s side. And the latter was all smiles alongside Victor Valdes as they travelled down to London on Friday. Falcao is one of several selection dilemmas that Van Gaal and assistant boss Ryan Giggs have to make for the trip against Chelsea; in what the Dutchman described  as ‘the worst scenario’. Michael Carrick (left) limped off against Manchester City while Marcos Rojo picked up an injury soon after . Van Gaal also revealed in his pre-match press conference that Daley Blind (left) and Phil Jones are out . Rooney (right) has impressed up front in recent weeks but may have to drop further back into midfield . Van Gaal (left) puts his arm round Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney during training this week . Van Gaal (left) has revealed that Rooney may play in holding midfield role against Chelsea . 4-1-4-1: De Gea; Valencia, Smalling, Blackett, Shaw; Rooney; Mata, Herrera, Fellaini, Young; Falcao . ‘I have to tell that we have four injuries who played the last match so that’s not so good for us,’ said Van Gaal. ‘We had very good hope that we should recover two of the four but it’s not like that. Carrick is out and Rojo is out, but also Blind and Jones,' the 63-year-old said at United's pre-match press conference on Friday. ‘That’s the worst scenario because Rojo and Jones are good players at the left central defender position. Evans is suspended so we don’t have many choices. Blind and Carrick could play the midfield holding position and I don’t have any other option, or I have to play Wayne Rooney in that position again. I have to puzzle a lot for tomorrow. ‘Other players can take profit of the momentum now. It’s always like that. It’s not special in the life of a manager or a team. ‘You have seen that I took Jones off pitch (against Manchester City) because of injury, you have seen that Carrick was off the pitch, you have seen the tackle of Kompany against Blind. Only Rojo is a little bit surprising because he felt it the day after the match. ‘It’s because of the distance between the matches. Blind and Jones were very close to playing but it was not enough. ‘Other players can take profit of the moment now. It’s always like that. It’s not special in the life of a manager or a team.’ Van Gaal addresses the media ahead of Man United's crucial Premier League clash with Chelsea on Saturday . Luke Shaw hasn't featured under Van Gaal recently but should return to play at left back . Mata (right) is closed down by his Man United team-mates during a training session on Friday .

Fellaini (centre right) is embraced by his team-mates after scoring against rivals Manchester City last week . Sports analysts BSports predict that a Chelsea win is easily the most likely outcome at Stamford Bridge . Asked if Shaw could return for the first time since being substituted in the FA Cup defeat to Arsenal last month amid concerns over his fitness, Van Gaal replied: ‘Maybe you shall see tomorrow [Saturday]. You never know. Luke is fit enough I think. He has already had more than four or five weeks with no match and I don’t like that. But we train and I think he is fit enough.’ With Chelsea holding an eight-point lead and a game in hand over third-placed United, Van Gaal believes it is asking too much for his team to win the title. He also claimed that Mourinho will be happy with a draw. ‘It’s still possible, I’ve said that before,’ he added. ‘It is not logical but it is possible. It’s more when and if, and I don’t believe in when and if. I believe in facts. The fact is that we are behind Chelsea. ‘But, alright, we have to play against them and so do Arsenal so we can lay pressure on Chelsea’s shoulders. You never know, you’ve seen it in previous Premier League seasons. So I cannot say it is not possible, but it is not logical. ‘They play at home but I think that Chelsea will be satisfied with a draw. Of course they will want to beat Manchester United and we want to beat them, the question is how long players can play in the discipline. Robin van Persie (back right) has only been training with United for a week but may return to feature . ‘We live for these titles, we are doing this for that. The only satisfaction you have as a manager is when you win a title. When you are second or third you can play Champions League, but a title is more fixed for you and you have your name on it. That’s why managers are fixated on titles. When you reach that goal you are happy. ‘To be involved in the game with young people to reach a goal, that is also a goal of mine. That is why I’m still a manager because I don’t have to work anymore – you can count on that. I like to work with young people and help them in their career.’ Van Gaal gave a young Mourinho his break in coaching at Barcelona. Asked to compare the Portuguese with his current assistant Ryan Giggs, the United boss admitted that he has been surprised by the Old Trafford legend’s work ethic. He said: ‘It’s always difficult. People compare with each other because Jose Mourinho was not the world-class player that Ryan Giggs was. So that’s the same thing with me. I was not as world-class as, for example, Johann Cruyff yet our ambition is maybe then higher. ‘But I have to admit that I could not imagine when I spoke with him (Giggs) in May or June to ask him to be my assistant manager and we spoke about how we saw it, that he works very hard. As an ex-player you are not used to working very hard and he is a very hard worker, and he reads the game very well like Jose. But to manage a group you have to work, and what I can see is that he’s learning quickly.’ Chris Smalling celebrates after netting the fourth goal in the comprehensive victory at Old Trafford .

Summary 1: Manchester United, led by Van Gaal and Rooney, are preparing for a Premier League clash against Chelsea, despite injuries to key players including Michael Carrick, Daley Blind, and Marcos Rojo. With Mata's return and potential recalls for Falcao and Shaw, United aim to extend their winning streak at Stamford Bridge.

Article:
A Pakistani man suspected of killing his fiancee and nine of her relatives after they appeared to be reluctant to give her permission to marry - months after he allegedly murdered his own parents. The 25-year-old suspect, who has been identified as Gul Ahmad Saeed, is alleged to have shot dead his fiancee, her parents and seven of her siblings on Sunday, police have said. Their deaths came just months after he is alleged to have killed his own parents, brother and sister-in-law after they objected to the match. Frustrated: Gul Ahmad Saeed is alleged to have gone on a killing spree after becoming angry with people obstructing his wedding plans. Pictured: Stock image of Pakistani brides and grooms at a mass wedding . Saeed has been on the run ever since, but returned to his home town in town in north-west Pakistan at the weekend - at which point he is suspected of killing his fiancee's family with the help of accomplices. He is said to have been outraged over her uncle's dithering over the marriage. 'The uncle was being very indecisive about the wedding which infuriated Gul Ahmad,' said police officer Mohammad Jamil. Police were searching for the suspects but they were believed to have fled into the semi-autonomous Pashtun tribal area along the Afghan border, where government authorities hold little sway and police are not legally permitted to go. 'We cannot follow anyone there since it is beyond our jurisdiction, and our security would be threatened,' said Jamil. Fled: Saeed, 25, is now said to be in the semi-autonomous Pashtun area, on the border with Afghanistan . The killings took place in a deeply conservative area where women there are often discouraged from going to school and have little choice when it comes to marriage. Pakistani women are often killed by men who feel their honour has been offended in some way. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported that 869 women were murdered in so-called honour killings in 2013, the last year for which data is available.

Summary 1: Gul Ahmad Saeed, a Pakistani man from north-west Pakistan, is suspected of murdering his fiancee and her family, including her parents and seven siblings, after they appeared reluctant to approve their marriage. This follows an earlier incident where Saeed allegedly killed his own family, who objected to the union. After the murders, Saeed fled to the semi-autonomous Pashtun tribal area along the Afghan border, a region beyond the reach of local law enforcement.

Summary 2: In north-west Pakistan, Gul Ahmad Saeed allegedly murdered his fiancee and her family, including her parents and seven siblings, due to their hesitance to approve their marriage. Earlier, Saeed reportedly killed his own family over objections to his wedding plans. His rage was exacerbated by his fiancee's uncle's indecisiveness, says police officer Mohammad Jamil. Post-murders, Saeed fled to the Pashtun tribal area, beyond police reach. The killings occurred in a conservative area known for honour killings, with 869 reported by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan in 2013.

Summary 3: This article discusses a tragic incident involving a Pakistani man named Gul Ahmad Saeed. He is suspected of killing his fiancee and her family, which includes her parents and seven siblings. This horrific act was allegedly committed after they seemed hesitant to approve their marriage. Interestingly, this incident occurred just a few months after Saeed is believed to have murdered his own family, including his parents, brother, and sister-in-law, who objected to his intended marriage.

Summary 4: Gul Ahmad Saeed, from north-west Pakistan, allegedly killed his fiancee and her family, including her parents and seven siblings, due to their reluctance to approve their marriage. Previously, Saeed reportedly murdered his own family over objections to his wedding plans. Saeed's rage was further fueled by his fiancee's uncle's indecisiveness, according to police officer Mohammad Jamil. After the killings, Saeed escaped to the Pashtun tribal area along the Afghan border, beyond police jurisdiction.

Anti-Semitic attacks surged worldwide by 38 per cent last year, with the highest number of incidents occurring in France, an annual study has revealed. The report, by Tel Aviv University's Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry, said 766 violent anti-Semitic acts were carried out around the world last year - marking a huge increase from the previous year. Arson, vandalism and direct threats against Jews, synagogues and other Jewish institutions were included in the figure, making 2014 the worst year for such attacks since 2009. The study said: 'The overall feeling among many Jewish people is one of living in an intensifying anti-Jewish environment that has become not only insulting and threatening, but outright dangerous. In particular, it cited 'alarming reports especially from Western Europe and North America'. Anger in Western Europe over Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip last July and August, as well as anti-Jewish caricatures in the media and social networks had helped to turn anti-Semitism into an 'almost daily phenomena seen and felt in every sphere of life', the report said. In France, the number of anti-Semitic attacks rose to 164 in 2014 compared with 141 in 2013. In January this year, four hostages were killed in a Paris kosher supermarket in violence that began when Islamist militants carried out a massacre in the office of the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly. Britain registered 141 violent incidents against Jews in 2014, after 95 a year earlier. In one of the most serious attacks a victim was called a 'Jewish c***' and then hit with a glass and a baseball bat in London. In Manchester, a man was knocked off his bike and kicked while on the ground by a group of youths who called him a 'Jew'. In January this year, four hostages were killed in a Paris kosher supermarket in an anti-Semitic attack . The violence began when Islamist militants carried out a massacre in the office of Charlie Hebdo magazine . And a Jewish girl had deodorant sprayed in her face by a 12-year-old fellow pupil who said to her 'gas the Jews' at a school in Edinburgh. The number of anti-Semitic acts in Germany and Italy more than doubled, to 76 and 23 respectively. In Western Europe in particular, the study said, 'the issue is not only a matter of having more security means provided by the respective states, but rather the ability to lead a full Jewish life... especially under heavy police and even army protection'. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stoked controversy in February when he called for 'mass immigration' of European Jews to Israel following a deadly shooting at a synagogue in Denmark. Under Israel's Law of Return, anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent has a right of immigration to Israel and, once there, can receive Israeli citizenship automatically.

Summary 1: Tel Aviv University's Kantor Center reports a 38% global rise in anti-Semitic attacks, predominantly in France. The study attributes this to an intensifying anti-Jewish environment, particularly in Western Europe and North America. Factors include Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip and anti-Jewish caricatures in media and social networks.

Summary 2: This article discusses a study by Tel Aviv University's Kantor Center, which reveals a significant surge in anti-Semitic attacks worldwide, with a 38% increase from the previous year. The highest number of these incidents occurred in France. The study includes violent acts such as arson, vandalism, and direct threats against Jews and Jewish institutions.

Summary 3: The Kantor Center reports a 38% surge in global anti-Semitic attacks, most notably in France, Western Europe, and North America, fueled by Israel's Gaza offensive and media caricatures. The study cites violent incidents in Britain and the Charlie Hebdo-related Paris kosher supermarket attack. A Manchester incident is also mentioned.

Summary 4: The Kantor Center cites a 38% surge in anti-Semitic attacks globally, with hotspots in France, Western Europe, North America, Britain, and incidents in Germany and Italy. Factors include Israel's Gaza offensive, media caricatures, and the Charlie Hebdo-linked Paris attack. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's call for Jewish immigration is also mentioned.

Hundreds of tourists had to be evacuated from Warwick Castle after a flaming cannonball set alight to a medieval thatched building during a display. Holidaymakers, many with young children enjoying the last day of the Easter break, had gathered to watch the cannonball be fired from the wooden trebuchet – the largest working siege machine in the world. However, the big display ended in catastrophe when sparks from the fireball ignited the roof of a nearby ancient boathouse, causing it to erupt into flames. The thatched building, which overlooks the River Avon within the castle grounds in Warwickshire, was unoccupied when it became engulfed in fire at about 5.45pm yesterday. Scroll down for video . Holidaymakers watched in horror as  a cannonball fired from a wooden trebuchet – the largest working siege machine in the world - struck a medieval thatched boathouse overlooking the River Avon at Warwick Castle . Witness Heather Taylor, 42, who had travelled from Birmingham with her six-year-old son Ethan to watch the cannonball launch, described the panic as the incident unfolded. She said: 'The trebuchet launched the flaming cannonball but as it flew almost over the boathouse sparks could clearly be seen coming off it and the high winds must have sent them onto the roof of the boathouse. 'There was a lot of panic and people were scrambling up the bank because they had no idea if the fire would spread. 'The place was packed with lots of young children and families. We were all evacuated and it was quite scary. 'It was shocking how fast the fire took hold. 'The cannonball actually appeared to land behind the boat house but it was obviously too close. 'It's such a shame because the boathouse has only just been re-thatched and we watched a chap thatching it before the big show. It's a medieval building so it's a big loss.' The catapult display ended in catastrophe when sparks from the cannonball ignited the roof of the ancient boathouse, causing it to erupt into flames at about 5.45pm. It forced an evacuated at the Warwick attraction . Video footage shows the medieval boathouse engulfed in flames after the flaming cannonball apparently set it alight yesterday afternoon. Warwick Castle said the attraction remains open today despite the incident .

A Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: 'We received a call at 5.47pm to a fire at the boathouse in the grounds of Warwick Castle. 'Three appliances were sent to the fire.' The historic boathouse, which was completely destroyed as a result of the fire, dates back to 1896. The 5th Earl, Frances Greville, had it built to house an electric boat which he powered by batteries charged from the electricity generated by the castle's mill. The trebuchet which fired the flaming cannonball stands 60ft high and weighs 22 tonnes. A flaming cannonball was launched from this wooden trebuchet, which stands 60ft high and weighs 22 tonnes, during a demonstration to show how the machine was used to hurl huge projectiles to breach the castle walls .

'We'd like to take this opportunity to thank Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service for their prompt assistance. 'Despite speculation we have not yet ascertained the cause of the fire. A full investigation is underway. 'The castle will be fully open today featuring our spectacular Easter events programme.' The trebuchet, which is 60ft tall and weighs 22 tonnes, was used to hurl projectiles at the castle . The wooden trebuchet is the largest working siege machine in the world and is effectively a colossal catapult. It is a recreation of one of the biggest and most deadly military machines of all times, which was used as a weapon for protection. The trebuchet, which stands 60ft high and weighs 22 tonnes, was used to hurl huge projectiles to breach the castle walls. Large rocks and stones were the main ammunition but there is evidence of more unusual material used such as large flaming cannonballs. Manure and dead animals were also hurled by the machine into the besieged castle to spread disease, with pigs among the top choice of animals to be fired. The trebuchet at Warwick Castle is an authentic recreation by Dr Peter Vemming, from The Mediaeval Centre in Nykobing, Denmark. Notes and drawings from the 13th century were used as the starting point for the reconstruction and were often referred to during the process of developing the working replica of the powerful machine. The trebuchet, which was built at a workshop in Wiltshire, is made primarily of oak with the long throwing arm made of ash and metal fixings holding it together. - Warwick Castle .

Article:
A couple bought a Beanie Baby for £10 at a car boot sale - and later realised it was worth £62,500. Leah Rogers and Ryan Flanaghan were selling a range of toys at the boot sale in Bude, Cornwall, when they spotted the purple teddy at another seller's stall. As a former collector, Mr Flanaghan, 22, recognised the bear as a limited edition Princess Diana Di Beanie Baby - one of the most sought after in the collection which can be worth thousands of pounds. Scroll down for video . Leah Rogers and Ryan Flanaghan (pictured together left) picked up a rare purple Beanie Baby for £10 at a car boot sale in Bude, Cornwall - and later found out it was worth £62,500 . The bear turned out to be one of just 100 made around the world, made in December 1997 for the Princess of Wales Memorial Trust. They are now selling it on eBay, with a starting bid of £20,000 . But the builder was stunned to find out that the bear was one of just 100 made around the world - and that another version is currently listed on eBay for £62,500. The pair are now hoping to sell the bear on the auction site and put the money towards a deposit for a house. Miss Rogers, 20, a beauty therapist who lives in Launceston, Cornwall, said: 'We couldn't believe it. We picked it up for £10 and it could be worth tens of thousands. 'It's so hard for young people to get on the property ladder so we think this could really be a blessing.' The pair had gone along to the car boot sale on Bank Holiday Monday with Mr Flanaghan's parents where they sold some of his old toys, including Beanie Babies. Before putting the teddies in the pile, the couple looked online to check that none of the bears would count as collectors' items. The pair, from Launceston, Cornwall, are now hoping the sale of the bear will give them a deposit for a house . While online, they read up about a Princess Diana Di Beanie Baby, which can sell for huge amounts. The range was created in December 1997 - the year the princess died - to raise money for the Princess of Wales Memorial Trust. It includes a poem on the tag which refers to Diana as an 'angel'. But even when he spotted the bear at another seller's stall, Mr Flanaghan had no idea whether it was a 'first edition' bear - which are incredibly rare - or a second edition, which sells for just £20. They later discovered the bear was handmade in Indonesia in December 2007 with special PE pellets and wording on the tag, which refers to the Princess Of Wales Memorial Fund - all of which make it a first edition bear. There is also a poem which reads: 'Like an angel she came from heaven above; she shared her compassion, her pain, her love; she only stayed with us long enough to teach the world to share, to give, to reach.' Another first edition Diana bear, the same as the one belonging to Miss Rogers and Mr Flanaghan, is currently being listed on eBay for £62,500 . Miss Rogers said: 'Ryan and his sister used to collect Beanie Babies so before we sold a load we just wanted check that they weren't worth anything. 'As we were looking, we saw that this purple bear was the rarest bear and it was going for around £20,000. We didn't think anything of it. 'But when we went to the car boot sale the next day, Ryan went off for a walk and came back clutching this bag. He said: "It's that bear that we saw on the internet last night".' The couple put it up for auction last night, with a starting bid of £20,000. A spokesman for Beanie fan club Ty Collector said only a handful of people know how many Process Bears were produced. The Beanie Babies were first introduced to the public in 1993, when creators Ty Warner Inc, which later became Ty Inc, launched its original line consisting of just nine characters. Over the next few years however hundreds of different types of Beanie Baby were produced as they gained in popularity. The company made an empire worth more than $6billion from the toys, boosted by the increase in people buying them as popular collectibles in 1995. At the peak of the collecting craze, many believed the designs which had been 'retired' would rise in value. The craze however failed to last much longer than 1999. Nowadays hundreds of the cuddly toys are sold on sites such as eBay - but they are not always worth as much money as collectors would originally have hoped. However, there are some which have certainly increased in price, including the 'ultra rare' Ty Princess Diana Di Beanie Baby, first edition, which can be sold for tens of thousands of pounds.

They later discovered that the Beanie Baby they bought was a rare, limited edition Princess Diana Di Beanie Baby, which is one of the most sought after in the collection.

Article:
What the hell am I doing, I ask myself, as I stand shivering on the brink. It’s April and my first proper swim of the year. The North Sea stretches before me. I dip a toe in. It’s absolutely freezing . . . of course. I wobble over the sharp shingle, into the waves, until I’m waist-deep. Gasping for breath, I take the plunge. And, within seconds, making frantic strokes, I’m swept up and I’m swimming. And it is glorious. Scroll down for video . Sarah Foot says her affair with open water began on Hampstead Heath after a local swimming pool closed down, and has taken her to swimming in the North Sea off the coast of Suffolk (pictured) I’m not one of those athletic people who glide through the water with a sleek, racing crawl - I’m that woman with the white-hatted head bobbing up and down offshore in a rather staid breast stroke . You don’t have to be watching Poldark for a dip in the sea to set your heart racing. I love to swim. Miserable winters, exams, love affairs . . . I’ve swum through them all, wherever I can find the water. Most of the time this means municipal pools from which I emerge reeking of chlorine and praying I’ve avoided verrucas. So best of all has to be swimming outdoors, and here on the East coast in Suffolk it is now warm enough — just about — for the sea. And despite the greyness, the appalling cold, and the downright bleakness of the North Sea here, I’m in heaven. The poet Byron — who was every bit as proud of his phenomenal swimming prowess as his verses — called the experience a ‘buoyancy of spirits I never feel on any other occasion’. I don’t have to swim the four-mile-long Hellespont between Asia and Europe as he did to know what he meant. I, too, am buoyed up in every way. Yet I’m not one of those athletic people who glide through the water with a sleek, racing crawl. Nor am I that hardy chap I read about recently, known as the ‘human polar bear’, who swims round icebergs in the Arctic. A 30-minute dip leaves me exhausted. I can’t even dive. You need look no further than Aidan Turner in Poldark to see how a dip in the ocean can set pulses racing . I’m that woman with the white-hatted head bobbing up and down offshore in a rather staid breast stroke. But in the water I don’t care. And, for me, that’s the magic of swimming. I am completely free. For a few precious moments, all my troubles wash away. Nothing bothers me and my whole world flows ‘swimmingly’. Of course, it would be easier to get in if it weren’t so damned cold — nudging a steely 8C (47F). Yet however enticing it is to bask in languid, tropical waters along with colourful fish, and laze about in Mediterranean and Caribbean seas, give me the Atlantic any day. Because, for me, the most perfect swim of all is in Scotland, off the Hebrides. What I love is the emptiness, the menthol cool of the water. On the Isle of Islay I have found deserted bays and swum completely alone or just with those I love, the sea crystal-clear and only the sound of the curlews and the water lapping over the rock pools. It’s not warm, of course, but immersed in that wild sea is the closest to beauty I have ever been. Why does it affect me so? Freud, not surprisingly, had a view on a love of swimming. He believed it disguised a desire to return to the amniotic waters of the womb. But that’s the sort of Freudian thing he would say. I prefer the thoughts of novelist Jane Austen, so much more restrained, who simply declared swimming ‘delightful’. She found the combination of sea air and sea water ‘nearly infallible’ and ‘a match for every disorder’. To the Romans, swimming was a most manly, heroic occupation, so much so that they defined an ignorant man as one who ‘neither knows how to read or swim’. Caligula, the cruel and brutally wanton Roman emperor, deemed himself a god but his contemporaries whispered he was a wimp — behind his back, presumably — because he couldn’t manage a front crawl or even a doggy-paddle. I came across a similar attitude when I lived in London and finally plucked up the courage to swim in the famous, natural, spring-fed ponds on Hampstead Heath. The exclusive ladies pond is in a picture-perfect setting, surrounded by trees and wild flowers. But I was scared to go in. The problem was I couldn’t see the bottom. The water was so black and deep, my thoughts would turn black and ominous too, imagining drowning and wondering how many rats were lurking in the murky shadows. But one day, the local indoor pool I used was unexpectedly closed. So I braved the pond. And it was a revelation. I felt I was swimming through silk. I never knew water could be so soft and I forgot about the rats and the unknown depths. And with all the passion of a convert I became so keen on the fresh water and splashing about with ducks I was determined to swim there all year round. Poet Lord Byron (left) was a prodigious swimmer, once crossing the four-mile Hellespont from Asia to Europe, while Jane Austen praised the sea air and water as 'a match for every disorder' I bought neoprene gloves and shoes and, as autumn came and the temperature dropped, I invested in a wet-suit. Because although there is something to be said for the way you emerge from cold water stinging and tingling as if heated by a feverish drug, I’m not hardy enough for swimming through liquid ice. But, unfortunately, I was not allowed to wear my new wetsuit — ‘not in the spirit of the ponds’, I was told by the strict Hampstead matriarchs who police it. And my passion faltered and I had to wait again for warmer weather. The coldness of our climate meant that, for centuries in Britain, swimming in the wild for pleasure was considered close to madness. The sea and rivers were regarded as sources of disease rather than pleasure. And the Church saw swimming as a rather sinful pursuit, possibly because Romans treated it as the opportunity for more erotic activities than a few hale and hearty lengths. But then, at the end of the 18th century, George III gave swimming the royal stamp of approval by taking dips in the sea off Weymouth, accompanied apparently by a band who struck up God Save The King every time he popped his head out of the water. In 1824, Britain’s first swimming society was formed by a group of Old Etonians. The David Camerons and Boris Johnsons of their day initiated non-swimmers by taking them out onto the River Thames and chucking them in. The Victorians had more gentle ways of learning to swim. A Boys Own Paper of 1879 suggested learning from frogs — by catching one, putting it in a bowl of water and then lying your body across a table and imitating the way it moved. George III brought swimming to fashion in England after years of scepticism from prudish members of the church . Whatever methods people learned to swim they were effective and, as more people took to the waters, something had to be done, in the name of modesty, about the habit of swimming naked. A cover-up campaign began, much to the annoyance of Francis Kilvert, a West Country curate who, in 1872, complained about the ‘detestable custom of bathing in drawers’. He loved ‘the delicious feeling of freedom in stripping in the open air and running down naked to the sea’. Forced to put on underwear (red and white striped) to conceal himself, he complained that: ‘If ladies don’t like to see men naked, why don’t they keep away from the sight?’ Indeed given the hysteria generated by Poldark actor Aidan Turner’s quick Cornish dip, watching men swimming seems to be a pleasure that has never dimmed. Personally, I hate being seen swimming, though others clearly don’t. On the nearest beach to me, the determinedly old-fashioned Aldeburgh on the Suffolk coast, I watch doughty local residents wander through the town in great towelling robes for a morning dip, proudly showing off bodies leathered and tanned by years of immersion in the sea. They are following in the footsteps of the composer Benjamin Britten, the town’s most famous resident, who extolled the virtues of cold water ‘just to wake you up’. On a good day, he’d manage as many as five ‘bathes’, as he called them, fitting them in between rehearsals and lunch, as well as late at night in the moonlight. His love affair with water lasted through his whole life. He composed the piano piece Early Morning Bathe, which captures all the initial pain and ultimate pleasure of a swim off the English coast — that ‘it’s lovely when you’re in’ feeling. But the problem, for me, is the indignity of actually getting in and out of the sea. It’s bad enough trying to keep your feet as you stagger in. But, unless it is unusually calm, there’s not a hope of emerging from the surf with the composure of bikini-clad Ursula Andress in the Bond film Dr No. As I get out, the waves can be so pebble-filled-heavy I’m often hurled flat on my face and have to scrabble over the stones on my stomach. But the humiliation of looking like a seal heaving itself onto dry land is worth it for the joy of that swim. So I will continue to confront the North Sea, take delight when the temperature climbs a few degrees as we head into summer in the weeks ahead and then grit my teeth again as it plummets back into winter. Because I know from experience that, whatever the season, once I’m swimming, I’m reminded, however briefly, how wonderful it is to be alive.

Summary 1: Sarah Foot, an open water swimming enthusiast, cherishes the solitude of the Hebrides and aligns with Jane Austen's view of swimming as 'delightful'. She notes the historical significance of swimming, from George III's royal approval to Victorian methods of learning. She also mentions Benjamin Britten, a composer and fellow swimmer, who found joy in the cold waters.

Summary 2: This article discusses the experiences of Sarah Foot, who has developed a passion for open water swimming. She describes her first swim of the year in the North Sea, highlighting the exhilaration and freedom she feels despite the cold. She also shares her journey from swimming in municipal pools to embracing the outdoors, particularly the sea off the coast of Suffolk.

Summary 3: Sarah Foot's love for open water swimming began at Hampstead Heath when a local pool closed. She describes the thrill of swimming in the North Sea and the Atlantic, despite the cold. Her favorite swim is in Scotland, off the Hebrides, where she enjoys the solitude and the coolness of the water.

Summary 4: Sarah Foot's passion for open water swimming, which began at Hampstead Heath, led her to the North Sea and the Atlantic. She cherishes the solitude in the Hebrides and dismisses Freud's theory that swimming is a desire to return to the womb. Instead, she aligns with Jane Austen's view of swimming as 'delightful' and the Romans' regard for it as a heroic occupation.

An app which allows users to superimpose images of gory injuries to photos of themselves has been slammed for 'making a mockery of violence'. Scar Booth, which is available from the Apple iTunes store for 79p, offers a gallery of 77 wounds - purportedly real ones - and its makers boast: 'Your friends and family will be convinced that you have suffered a painful beating.' Anti-violence charities have hit back at the disturbing app for trivialising, or 'glorifying' abuse and brutality. Scroll down for video . Disturbing: Scar Booth, which I tested out myself (pictured), offers a gallery of 77 wounds - purportedly real ones - which can be superimposes onto selfies so you can 'prank' friends and family, according to the app . BulliesOut, a Cardiff-based anti-bullying charity, hit out at Scar Booth via Facebook, stating: 'People have to live with real scars... from self-harming, and suffer cuts and bruises from being bullied. 'This app makes a mockery of their injuries and what they have been/are going through.' Adam Fouracre, founder of violence prevention charity Stand up to Violence, concurred. ‘It’s a very negative thing about the society we live in if people think this sort of thing is fun or funny,' he said. According to the app's description, issued by its developer Appdicated, its main purpose is to prank friends and family. 'Load any picture and add virtual wounds to the photo, adjust the transparency of the image to make it look like it is a real injury. [It] will FREAK out just about anyone who sees it.' Mr Fouracre, who launched Stand up to Violence in 2005 after his brother was beaten to death in a random, violent attack late at night, insists it 'glorifies violence'. He argues: 'When people see these pictures they are going to be heartbroken and thinking something really is wrong.' Not so hilarious: The app's description reads, 'Your friends and family will be convinced that you have suffered a painful beating' Backlash: Anti-violence charities have accused the app of 'making a mockery' of abuse and 'glorifying violence' Appdicated founder Rory Boyer defended the app, stating: ‘Scars and bruises do not have to come from violence and this app was created to prank friends and not to glorify violence.’ Although the app is not intended for use by those under the age of 17, photos exist on Twitter of at least one young boy posing in his pajamas with the app's injuries covering his face, captioned: 'My face has been injured. Help Me'. And one iTunes review reads: 'I had so much fun mutilating myself and the rest of my family. I sent them to fb & fooled everyone.' Mr Boyer insists that his company has not been contacted by a single anti-violence charity and says any concerns over the suitability of the app are 'very surprising to hear'.

Summary 1: Scar Booth, an app sold on Apple's iTunes store for 79p, lets users overlay 77 different wound images onto their photos. Developed by Appdicated, it's intended to prank friends and family, but has drawn criticism for making light of violence, prompting backlash from anti-violence charities.

Summary 2: Scar Booth, a 79p iTunes app by Appdicated, lets users prank with 77 wound images. Despite criticism from BulliesOut and Adam Fouracre's Stand up to Violence, founder Rory Boyer defends it, stating it's not for under 17s. Yet, Twitter shows young users participating.

Summary 3: Appdicated's Scar Booth, available on iTunes for 79p, offers 77 wound images for users to superimpose on photos as pranks. However, charities like BulliesOut and Stand up to Violence, led by Adam Fouracre, criticize it for trivializing violence, sparking a backlash.

Summary 4: This article discusses an application named Scar Booth, available on the Apple iTunes store for 79p, which allows users to superimpose images of gory injuries onto their photos. The app has been criticized for trivializing violence and abuse. The article also mentions the backlash from anti-violence charities.

A Walmart employee has been applauded for his honesty after finding $4,400 worth of cash in the parking lot and handing it over to authorities, who returned it to its relieved owner. Brian Cassidy was picking up trash outside the store in Bangor, Maine on Thursday when he discovered the wet stack of money beneath a large piece of paper in the parking lot. He immediately contacted store security to tell them what he had found and, realizing it was a sizable sum, they then contacted the police department, Sergeant Tim Cotton said. Officer Dustin Dow went to the store to take the report and learned that a man had visited the security office last winter to claim he had lost about $4,000 in the parking lot. Great work: Brian Cassidy, right, is pictured being presented with a Bangor Police Department Challenge coin by an officer after he found $4,400 cash in a Walmart parking lot and alerted security . The man, who was later identified as Ou Chen, said at the time that he had put the money in an envelope in his pocket after leaving work at a nearby restaurant. He had intended to send the money home to his family, Cotton said. But after clearing snow off his car and driving home, he realized that his pocket was empty. Chen went to the security office to ask if the money had been turned in or if surveillance footage had revealed what could have happened to it, but nothing emerged. When Dow heard of the story, he went to the nearby restaurant, Kobe Steakhouse, and asked for the man, and Chen confirmed he had misplaced the cash. After counting the money at the station, the officer returned to the restaurant to give it back to him - and to take a picture showing him gladly accepting it. Returned: The money belonged to Ou Chen, who lost the $4,000 as he cleared snow off his car last winter after leaving his job at a nearby restaurant. He told Walmart about it at the time but they could not find it . Stash: Cassidy found the money, pictured, while picking up trash near the Walmart parking lot last Thursday . Cotton applauded Brian for his honesty, particularly because the Walmart employee found the money while working at a job that does not pay much. 'Brian is not getting rich doing this and has dealt with other issues over the past year,' Cotton explained in a lengthy Facebook post. 'Brian, like many people, has even had to sleep in his car for a time when things were rough.' In recognition of his honesty, Cassidy was presented with a Bangor Police Department Challenge coin 'for being honest and having great integrity in doing his job', the department said. 'Brian Cassidy personifies what we hope is in all of us,' Cotton wrote. 'Thanks Brian, the men and women of the Bangor Police Department salute you.' Scene: Cassidy, who works at this Walmart in Bangor, Maine, was thanked for his honesty and integrity .

Summary 1: Walmart's Brian Cassidy found $4,400 in the parking lot, reported it, and it was returned to Ou Chen from Kobe Steakhouse. Sergeant Tim Cotton and Officer Dustin Dow from the Bangor Police Department handled the case, praising Cassidy's honesty. Cassidy was awarded a Bangor Police Department Challenge coin for his integrity.

Summary 2: This article discusses an incident involving a Walmart employee named Brian Cassidy who found a substantial amount of money, specifically $4,400 in cash, in the parking lot of the store where he works. He demonstrated commendable honesty by immediately reporting his discovery to the relevant authorities, who were then able to return the money to its rightful owner.

Mamadou Sakho limped off early on in Liverpool's 1-0 FA Cup sixth round replay win over Blackburn Rovers to leave Brendan Rodgers with just two available first-team centre backs. The French defender was limping heavily and clutching his hamstring after a clearance on the edge of his own penalty area before being withdrawn after just 28 minutes at Ewood Park. Sakho was replaced by Kolo Toure, who partnered Dejan Lovren in a threadbare four-man defence with Emre Can and Martin Skrtel already unavailable. Mamadou Sakho limped off early on in Liverpool's 1-0 FA Cup sixth round replay win over Blackburn Rovers . Frenchman was limping heavily and clutching his hamstring after a clearance on the edge of his penalty area . German midfielder-cum-defender Can was serving a one match ban for a red card against Arsenal on Sunday, while Skrtel still has one game left of his three-game suspension for stamping on Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea last month. Sakho will undergo scans on Thursday to determine the extent of the injury but he is already a doubt for Liverpool's Barclays Premier League clash with Newcastle United on Monday. Rodgers, who has tended to select three central defenders before the FA Cup replay, will be hoping the 25-year-old can return to action as soon as possible. Brendan Rodgers who has tended to select three central defenders, will be hoping for a quick recovery . Martin Skrtel (left), pictured on international duty, is still missing with a suspension picked up for a stamp .

Summary 1: This article discusses the unfortunate event of Mamadou Sakho, a French defender for Liverpool, limping off the field during Liverpool's 1-0 FA Cup sixth round replay win over Blackburn Rovers. Sakho was seen clutching his hamstring, indicating a potential injury. The extent of the injury is yet to be determined, but it has left Liverpool's team in a precarious position.

Summary 2: Liverpool's manager, Brendan Rodgers, had to rely on Kolo Toure and Dejan Lovren after Mamadou Sakho's hamstring injury in the 1-0 FA Cup win over Blackburn.

Article:
David Cameron (pictured) said he knows that when it comes to immigration, 'fears and worries' remain . Let me reassure you, I know that when it comes to immigration, fears and worries remain. They were set out on the front page of this newspaper yesterday. And I want to set out exactly the choice before you on May 7. I am not one of those politicians who says they ‘get’ how people feel about immigration then speaks differently in private. Sitting in the House of Commons from 2001, I had a ringside seat on Labour’s complete failure on immigration – and it was infuriating. Fake colleges, bogus visas, wide open loopholes, the wrong welfare incentives, sham marriages, an abject failure to deport foreign criminals, migrants bringing family members to Britain even if they couldn’t speak a word of English – a litany of failure. Underpinning it all was contempt for the views of most British people. We all remember Peter Mandelson’s boast that Labour was practically ‘sending out search parties’ for migrants. The mess took 13 years to create – and over the past five years we have been working to turn this around. Economic migration from outside the EU has been capped at 20,700 skilled professionals a year. We have closed down over 850 of those bogus colleges that were basically visa factories. There are new charges for migrants using the NHS; there is no social housing unless you’ve been in an area for two years; and there is no housing benefit full-stop for EU jobseekers. Critically, we now have proper exit checks at our borders so we know who is coming in and going out. On top of all this direct action to control immigration, we recognised that the rising immigration numbers weren’t just about lax borders and a system easily abused; it was about British people not being trained to get into the jobs that were becoming available – or not incentivised to work at all, because of Labour’s welfare system. So we have had a huge, unprecedented push on welfare and training, with two million young people starting apprenticeships, and vast numbers getting off welfare and into work. The result of all this? Consider these remarkable two facts. Under Labour, for years, 90 per cent of job growth was taken up by foreign workers. With the Conservatives, two-thirds of our job growth now benefits British citizens. That is a remarkable turnaround. I’m not saying there isn’t a lot more to do. It’s clear that, as our economy has taken off, the bigger issue has become migration from within Europe. And while we have not yet reduced net migration down to the tens of thousands each year, it remains the right ambition. So why have many more EU migrants come here? Partly it’s our extraordinary economic success, with Britain creating more jobs than 27 other European countries combined. But large numbers have also been drawn here because of incentives in things like tax credits and welfare. These have been a powerful draw to EU workers. Scroll down for video . David Cameron said under the Conservatives, two-thirds of the UK's job growth now benefits British citizens . That is why, in the manifesto we published last week, we had some very clear and hard-headed proposals. Elect a Conservative government, and I will start negotiating a new deal with Europe straight away. It will involve: no benefits at all for EU jobseekers. If you haven’t got a job within six months, you’ll be required to leave. If you’ve got a job, you will get no in-work benefits until you’ve been here and contributing to our country for at least four years. And no child benefit for children of EU migrants living abroad – ever. This is what I’m seeking. I will fight, negotiate, do all I can to secure a better deal for Britain. And then we would put this to the British people in an in-out referendum in 2017. The capsizing of a boat full of migrants in the Mediterranean at the weekend was absolutely shocking. Eight hundred people died in the most horrific of circumstances, so it’s also right that Britain – not just a compassionate country but a strong one too – does what it can to prevent such scenes from ever happening again. That’s why I went to Brussels yesterday to help deliver a response. Of course, we need more search and rescue missions – and our Royal Navy is ready to play its part alongside other navies. We need to hunt down the traffickers who prey on human misery, deal with the boats that bring people across the seas and help foster stable conditions in countries which export so much illegal immigration. Only then will we properly get to grips with this situation – building confidence at home that people can’t come here illegally; and helping people abroad life safe and secure lives. All of this is a serious, grown-up plan for reducing immigration long-term. And it is based on some straightforward values. Immigration should be about welcoming those who can contribute to our country; who want to come to Britain, pay their way, make a life here, and abide by British values. This is our approach. And this presents you with a clear choice on immigration on May 7. There can only be one Prime Minister in Number Ten, only one person ultimately responsible for controlling immigration: me, or Ed Miliband. Do you honestly think Ed Miliband cares about controlling immigration? No. He was there the last time, remember, when net immigration increased five-fold. His arrogant refusal even to discuss numbers – let alone speak about any reduction – tells you all you need to know. But the facts of this election have changed – and it’s even worse. The only way Ed Miliband can get into Downing Street is if he is propped up by the SNP – and they have made clear that they want higher levels of immigration. It’s clear: Ed Miliband in Downing Street would increase immigration, not reduce it. And if you’re someone considering voting Ukip because you want a referendum on Europe and controlled immigration, remember that a vote for Ukip makes it harder for Conservatives to win – and much more likely for Ed Miliband and the SNP to get into government. Then you will get no referendum, and a return to uncontrolled immigration. So this is the choice. If I am Prime Minister after May 7 I will see through this serious, sustained attempt to control immigration long-term. I will get Britain a better deal in Europe – and I will give the British people the final say in an in-out referendum. If you want those things, there’s only one way to get them: vote Conservative on May 7.

Summary 1: This article discusses the views of David Cameron on the topic of immigration. He acknowledges the fears and worries that persist in the public's mind regarding this issue. Cameron aims to address these concerns and present his stance on immigration before the public on May 7. He emphasizes his commitment to understanding and addressing the complexities of immigration.

Summary 2: Cameron blames Labour's welfare system for incentivizing immigration and not training British citizens for available jobs. He touts Conservative reforms, including new charges for migrants using the NHS and no housing benefits for EU jobseekers. He also addresses the issue of EU migration, attributing it to Britain's economic success and welfare incentives.

Summary 3: Cameron proposes a new deal with Europe, including no benefits for EU jobseekers and a four-year wait for in-work benefits. He promises an in-out referendum on EU membership if the Conservatives win.

Multiple ghosts supposedly inhabit an expensive New York City apartment building, which recently added Academy Award-nominated actress Jessica Chastain to its list of occupants. Two residents from the Osborne Apartments on West 57th Street in Manhattan told the New York Post of their experiences with spirits in the building. Chastain and her boyfriend, Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo, spent $5.1 million on an apartment that features four bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms, Daily Mail Online reported early last month. Chastain most recently appeared on the big screen in the 2014 films Interstellar and A Most Violent Year. Purchase: Jessica Chastain recently purchased a $5.1 million apartment at The Osborne. The building is supposedly haunted by spirits . Friendly ghosts? The ghosts of opera singer Johanna Gadski (left) and Alfredo Taylor (right) are thought to haunt the Osborne Apartments on West 57th Street . Residence: Chastain's new home at The Osborne (pictured) features four bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms . Convenient: The space is located in New York City's Midtown neighborhood and not far from Central Park . Relax: The space features high ceiling and windows that let lots of light in . The Osborne is located close to Carnegie Hall and is a few blocks away from Columbus Circle, Central Park and Lincoln Center. One of The Osborne's longtime residents, Naomi Guffman, recently told the Post 'I have a poltergeist!' She thinks the ghost is actually one of the apartment's former tenants, Metropolitan Opera singer Johanna Gadski, according to the newspaper. The Post described Gadski as 'a red-haired practical joker' who was killed in a 1932 Berlin car accident. Guffman told the Post '[Me and my husband would] be standing in the hallway talking and the toilet would start to flush.' She also described doors randomly opening and water on the stove boiling of its own accord. Retreat: Chastain and her boyfriend Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo can hideaway in one of the apartment's four bedrooms . Classic: The apartment also features lots of wood paneling and design elements . Macabre: Ghosts supposedly inhabit The Osborne, according to some of its residents . In 1971, fellow resident Davida Deutsch and her husband heard a booming noise the first night they spent in their apartment and woke up, the newspaper reported. The couple earlier placed a broom close by and were already aware of ghost speculation, according to the Post. The newspaper reported that the Osborne Apartments are allegedly haunted by architect Alfredo Taylor's ghost as he takes the elevator and walks around hallways. Taylor came up with the plan for the building's 1906 addition. Taylor is also known for being the architect behind multiple buildings in Norfolk, Connecticut. The Osborne's resident manager John Coyne told the Post of Taylor 'I haven’t come across anything strange. I don’t know if that means if he's moved on or he's moved out.' MailOnline reported last month that in 1978, the bodies of actors Gig Young and Kim Schmidt were found in an apartment at The Osborne, supposedly the result of a murder-suicide carried out by Young. Nap time: Another bedroom in the apartment is seen with windows looking out toward other New York City buildings in the neighborhood . Unwind: Chastain's apartment also includes a sitting room with high ceilings and wood detailing .

Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville has laid into referee Lee Mason after he failed to award Newcastle a penalty during their 2-0 defeat at Liverpool on Monday night. An incident in the 38th minute of the game, saw Ayoze Perez felled by a reckless challenge from Dejan Lovren. Although replays clearly showed the defender scything Perez down and not making contact with the ball, Mason did not point to the spot. Neville said during his analysis, 'It was an absolute stonewall penalty. The gasp in the ground, Lovren just kicks him right in the knee.' Ayoze Perez drives into the Liverpool box on 38 minutes only to be brought down by Dejan Lovren . Lovren makes a rash challenge and does not make any contact with the ball, sending the Spaniard tumbling . Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville could not believe that a spot kick was not awarded to the Magpies at Anfield . He added that Mason's perfect positioning should have led him to make the correct call. 'I think we said it last week, in the game, we always look at the ref's position. But you look at Lee Mason's view of it and he's got no excuse, he's staring right at it there, he's so close, within five or six yards. It's just a poor decision.' Before Lovren's foul, Raheem Sterling had put Liverpool in front with a curling effort just inside the box on 9 minutes; and Joe Allen wrapped up the three points for the home side with a rifled shot into the roof of the net late on following a failed clearance from Mike Williamson. The misery was only to be compounded for Newcastle, as stand-in captain Moussa Sissoko saw red for a second bookable offence. With Newcastle trailing 1-0, a penalty could have offered them a way back into the game, but nothing was given . Perez lies on the ground as Glenn Johnson (left) clears the ball and Lovren (right) protests his innocence . Moussa Sissoko (right) hands the captain's armband to his manager after he is sent off for a stamp .

Summary 1: This article discusses the comments made by Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville regarding a controversial decision made by referee Lee Mason during a football match between Newcastle and Liverpool. Neville criticized Mason for not awarding a penalty to Newcastle after Dejan Lovren made a reckless challenge. Neville believed that Mason's positioning should have allowed him to make the correct call.

Summary 2: Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville criticized referee Lee Mason for not awarding a penalty to Newcastle when Dejan Lovren recklessly challenged Ayoze Perez. Neville argued that Mason's position should have enabled him to see the incident clearly and make the correct decision. The penalty could have provided Newcastle with a potential route back into the game.

Summary 3: Gary Neville slammed referee Lee Mason's decision to not award a penalty to Newcastle after Ayoze Perez was challenged by Dejan Lovren. Liverpool, who had goals from Raheem Sterling and Joe Allen, could have faced a comeback from Newcastle if the penalty was given. Neville insisted Mason's position should have led to the correct call.

Summary 4: Gary Neville criticized Lee Mason for not awarding Newcastle a penalty after Dejan Lovren's challenge on Ayoze Perez. Liverpool, with goals from Raheem Sterling and Joe Allen, benefited from the decision. Newcastle's Moussa Sissoko received a red card, and Mike Williamson's failed clearance led to Liverpool's second goal.

Article:
Catania, Sicily (CNN)We are at the beginning of a massive and mounting crisis with no solution in sight. Perhaps that's incorrect. The migrant crisis that has suddenly drawn hundreds of journalists to Sicily has been brewing for years, but in the past 10 days, with as many as 1,600 deaths in the Mediterranean, suddenly minds are focused -- for now. Almost exactly four years ago, in Libya, I caught, perhaps, a glimpse of what was to come. It was late at night in the besieged city of Misrata. Hundreds of African migrants were caught between the Libyan civil war (back then some optimistically called it a "revolution") and the deep blue sea. They had come to Misrata from Ghana, Nigeria and elsewhere, hoping to board rickety boats to cross the sea to Europe. They had been pinned down under sporadic shelling from government forces, but weren't welcome by the rebels who controlled the city. They appealed to us to help them escape. We could do nothing, but they may have eventually found their way out when the fighting subsided. The fall of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's regime, which we reporters covered so avidly, was followed by chaos, which we in the news media largely neglected, focused as we journalists were on the next catastrophe, the Syrian civil war. In that chaos, the business of human trafficking has boomed. And now that boom in human misery is coming in waves to the shores of Italy. The focus today is on those lost at sea. Aware of the tragedy underway, however, Italians are alarmed at the prospect that this year alone as many as a million migrants could arrive in Europe, according to one European Union official. That is certainly the case in the Sicilian port of Catania, where many migrants arrive. The city's mayor, Enzo Bianco, insists city residents bear no ill will toward the migrants, but says Catania, and Sicily cannot absorb the ever-growing numbers. The rest of Europe must help carry the burden. "If something serious isn't done," he warns, "dramas like these will be repeated. This problem will not be resolved by hiding our heads in the sand." Increasingly, some Italians are losing their patience. Two northern regions, Veneto and Valle d'Aosta, have declared they will no longer accept new migrants. The rightist Lega Nord has made opposition to new migrants a pillar of its party program. Others, however, insist Italy must keep its doors open. In Catania port, I spoke with Grazia Giurato, who had joined a small protest in solidarity with the migrants. "Many years ago, our grandparents emigrated," she recalled. "Let's keep that in mind." Indeed, in tougher times, millions of impoverished Italians left their homeland to settle in the Americas and Australia. They, too, like the migrants from Africa and the Middle East, were fleeing grinding poverty and war. And they, too, experienced the kind of prejudice and resentment in lands their descendants now proudly call home. That's the long view, perhaps. But now, today, Italians are grappling to deal with the consequences of an array of old and new ills, ranging from failing states and failing economies to endemic corruption, hopeless poverty, oppression and injustice that no one state or group of states can solve without a gargantuan, expensive and politically daunting effort. And while this crisis has been brewing for years, it is now truly upon us.

Summary 1: Sicily's migrant crisis, exacerbated by the Libyan civil war and booming human trafficking, has seen 1,600 deaths in the Mediterranean. Catania's mayor, Enzo Bianco, warns of the city's inability to absorb growing migrant numbers, while northern regions refuse new arrivals, escalating Italy's alarm over the unresolved crisis.

Summary 2: The Sicilian migrant crisis, intensified by the Libyan civil war and human trafficking, has led to 1,600 Mediterranean deaths. Catania's mayor, Enzo Bianco, and northern regions express concern over absorbing migrants. Grazia Giurato, a protester, recalls Italy's emigration history amidst an array of socio-economic ills, escalating the crisis.

Summary 3: The migrant crisis in Sicily, intensified by the Libyan civil war, has led to a surge in human trafficking and the tragic loss of 1,600 lives in the Mediterranean. Italians are increasingly alarmed as the crisis, with no immediate solution, could see up to a million migrants arriving in Europe this year.

Summary 4: This article discusses the escalating migrant crisis in Sicily, which has been brewing for years but has recently drawn significant attention due to the tragic loss of as many as 1,600 lives in the Mediterranean in the past 10 days. The situation is complex and there appears to be no immediate solution in sight.

Article:
Anyone who has witnessed a game of hockey or netball might disagree, but men really are more competitive than women, according to a new study. Researchers have discovered that male athletes are more driven by the desire to beat the competition than female athletes. Sportswomen tend to be more committed to aspects of their lives outside sport - such as their academic studies - than their male counterparts, the researchers say. The researchers found that male 5,000 metre runners are more competitive than women. Great Britain's Mo Farah is pictured above running to victory in the European Athletics Championships in Helsinki, Finland . This may explain why boys are often seen as being more competitive. However, the researchers say that there can be a great deal of individual variability with some women actually showing greater competitive drive than most male athletes. Many reasons have been suggested to explain why women remain poorly represented in senior positions at large companies. Now, a new study may shed light on workplace dynamics, by claiming that while men enjoy competition in the office, women like to be part of a team. The results suggest than men have a dimmer view of their colleagues’ ability than women and were therefore more keen on competing to be rewarded for their own work, rather than that of a team’s. Researchers from CNRS-GATE in Lyon and the University of California, analysed the behaviour of both sexes when the study participants were asked to choose between being paid on their individual performance or as part of a team. They found that less than 11 per cent of men opted for team payment, in comparison to 44 per cent of women. These individuals tend to be far less common in women's sport, they said. The study could have implications for other areas outside sport, such as in the workplace where greater gender diversity could bring advantages. Professor Robert Deaner, a psychologist at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, said they studied elite runners because it is a sport that is equally popular among men and women and there is no disparity in prize money. He said: 'Of course, we need to be careful not to assume that our running results will generalise to all sports or all domains outside of sports. 'Nevertheless, our findings do echo those from other studies, which show that even when men and women hold the same selective jobs, men are more likely to prioritize competing for recognition and status, while women have more communal orientations.' The researchers, whose study is published in the journal PeerJ, assessed the competitiveness of 1,147 long distance runners competing in the 5,000 metres in the US National Collegiate Athletic Association. They surveyed each runners motivation for participating, their training volume and their desire to compete at an elite level after college. US tennis player John McEnroe (above) was notorious for letting his competitiveness get the better of him . The study found that male long distance runners, like Mo Farrah (left), are more competitive than women, but there are some women, like Paula Radcliffe on the right, who are arguably more competitive than the men . They also compared runners who were competing NCAA's Division 1, Division 2 and Division 3. The researchers found that men were far more competitive at all levels than female runners. The sex difference in competitiveness was also just as large in the fastest runners in Division 1 compared to the slower ones in Division 3. Professor Deaner said: 'By social science standards, the difference we found - men and women differing by about half a standard deviation on competitiveness measures - is moderate to large. 'But this kind of a difference still means that many of the female runners are more competitive than many of the male runners.' Writing in the journal the researchers added: 'Women did report greater commitment than men to their academic studies, suggesting a sex difference in priorities. 'Therefore, policies aiming to provide men and women with equal opportunities to flourish should acknowledge that sex differences in some kinds of preferences and motivation may persist even in selective sub-populations.' Serena Williams is known for her intensely competitive attitude, playing through injury and destroying raquets .

Summary 1: The PeerJ study by CNRS-GATE in Lyon and the University of California, in collaboration with Grand Valley State University, analyzed competitiveness among male and female 5,000 metre runners in the US National Collegiate Athletic Association. It found a significant sex difference in competitiveness, with men being more competitive in both sports and workplace settings. Men were less likely to choose team payment, indicating a preference for individual recognition.

Summary 2: The study, published in PeerJ by CNRS-GATE in Lyon and the University of California, found that male 5,000 metre runners are more competitive than their female counterparts. The researchers also examined workplace dynamics, finding that men prefer competition, while women prefer teamwork. When given the choice between individual or team payment, less than 11% of men chose team payment, compared to 44% of women.

Summary 3: A study by researchers from CNRS-GATE in Lyon and the University of California, published in the journal PeerJ, suggests that men are generally more competitive than women. The study, which focused on athletes, found that male athletes tend to be more driven by the desire to outperform their competition, while female athletes often prioritize other aspects of their lives, such as academic studies. However, the researchers noted that there is significant individual variability, with some women displaying a greater competitive drive than many men.

Summary 4: The study by CNRS-GATE, University of California, and Grand Valley State University, published in PeerJ, analyzed competitiveness among elite runners in the NCAA's Division 1, Division 2, and Division 3. It found a significant sex difference in competitiveness and priorities, with men being more competitive and women prioritizing academics. Men were also less likely to choose team payment in workplace settings.

Serie A champions Juventus want to strengthen their attacking options this summer with a big-money move for PSG striker Edinson Cavani, according to a report in Italy. Corriere dello Sport claim that Juve have a plan in place to sign the in-demand Uruguayan as they look to partner him with fellow South American Carlos Tevez. Cavani, who played for Italian sides Palermo and Napoli before joining PSG in a £50million deal in 2013, has admitted his frustration at being played out of position under Laurent Blanc. PSG striker Edinson Cavani (left) is a target for Juventus according to Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport . Manchester United also hold an interest in Cavani, pictured in action against Marseille last weekend . He told Canal Plus: 'The only concern that I have ever spoken about is that I was recruited to play as a striker with (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic and it has not always been the case. 'There is a long series of games where I have not scored in Ligue 1 but that can happen. In France, people judge me as a lone striker, but I do not play in that position.' Former Manchester United boss David Moyes attempted to sign Cavani before he joined PSG and the Old Trafford club remain interested in acquiring him when the transfer window reopens. Louis van Gaal is hoping to bring two new strikers to Old Trafford this summer with Radamel Falcao unlikely to turn his loan move into a permanent one and Robin van Persie being eyed by both Juve and Inter Milan. United appear to have an advantage over Juventus in their pursuit of Cavani after the player's agent, Claudio Anelucci, admitted that a move to England or Spain was most likely. Cavani (left) has admitted that he is concerned about playing out of position under Laurent Blanc (right) Cavani's agent Claudio Anelucci says his client is most likely to move to England or Spain this summer . He told Gazzetta dello Sport: 'Is Cavani on the market? At this point it's a little early to say. 'Edi is under contract at Paris Saint-Germain and there are several factors that come into play with respect to his future.' 'Once the situation is clarified there are several different scenarios given that players like him, at his level of maturity, are coveted by the biggest clubs in Europe. 'The market would seem to suggest Spain or England - we can't say at the present time that an Italian club could participate in the bidding for Cavani.'

Summary 1: Juventus plans a major transfer for PSG's Edinson Cavani to pair with Carlos Tevez. Cavani, unhappy at PSG under Laurent Blanc and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, is also a target for Manchester United, who may lose Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie. Cavani's agent, Claudio Anelucci, hinted at a move to England or Spain in Gazzetta dello Sport.

Summary 2: This article discusses the potential transfer of Edinson Cavani, a striker currently playing for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), to Juventus. The Italian champions are reportedly planning a significant investment to secure Cavani's services, as they aim to bolster their attacking options. The Uruguayan forward, who has previously played for Italian clubs Palermo and Napoli, is said to be frustrated with his current position at PSG.

Summary 3: Juventus eyes PSG's Edinson Cavani for a high-profile transfer to boost their attack with Carlos Tevez. Cavani, ex-Palermo and Napoli player, is unhappy with his position under PSG's Laurent Blanc, alongside Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Manchester United, where David Moyes once tried to sign Cavani, is also interested, as Radamel Falcao's permanent move seems unlikely.

Summary 4: Juventus, the Serie A champions, are reportedly planning a big-money move for PSG striker Edinson Cavani to strengthen their attack alongside Carlos Tevez. Cavani, formerly of Palermo and Napoli, has expressed dissatisfaction with his role under PSG coach Laurent Blanc. Meanwhile, Manchester United also shows interest in Cavani.

Shane Dunn, 25, from Tunbridge Wells, stabbed victim Ian Garrod, 55, in the neck after meeting on the gay dating app Grindr . A drug-fuelled thug calling himself 'Gypsy Lad' slashed a middle-aged man around the throat with a kitchen knife after meeting him on the gay dating app Grindr. Shane Dunn, 25, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, carried out the attack after going back to Ian Garrod's home in Medway for sex in September last year. But when the 55-year-old sat on the bed, Dunn - who was said to be 'cool as a cucumber' during the attack - stabbed him  in the throat. Dunn, who was high on Class A Mephedrone, then left Mr Garrod in fear of his life, before fleeing from the property with his victim's wallet, iPhone, iPad and jewellery. The callous attacker even pretended to call an ambulance for his victim, but instead left him for dead with a 6cm-deep wound. He was later caught after police examined two cigarette butts found in Mr Garrod's garden - both of which had DNA linking to the attacker. Luckily, Mr Garrod's housemate returned the the property and called an ambulance. The court heard it was only by the skill of a surgeon at Medway Maritime Hospital that the victim's life was saved. Dunn has now been jailed for 12 years after being found guilty of wounding with intent. He was cleared by a jury of attempted murder. Judge Jeremy Carey told Dunn he had narrowly decided against finding him dangerous, which would have led to an extended sentence. Judge Carey said Dunn was convicted of the wounding charge 'on the clearest evidence'. He said: 'You asserted you effectively were not the person who stabbed Ian Garrod and the jury found on the evidence you were and you intended to cause him really serious harm. 'It was hardly surprising since you cut his throat to a depth of 6cm. Only by the skill of a surgeon at Medway Maritime Hospital the flow of the blood was clipped and stemmed. 'Otherwise, you would have been convicted of murder.' The judge said there were 'inevitable uncertainties' about what happened that night. He continued: 'I am quite sure you did not attend there with the intention of committing acts of violence. I am quite sure something happened that night that caused you to lose it. Maidstone Crown Court heard how Dunn was caught after police examined two cigarette butts found in Mr Garrod's garden - both of which had DNA linking to the attacker . 'You say you don't remember. I don't know if you do or not. You are not a man prone to extreme violence. 'I think by a combination of a Class A drug you used that night and the revelation of something possibly to do with HIV on the part of Mr Garrod you lost it. 'You got a knife from the block and went upstairs and, cool as a cucumber, you slit his throat. Anyone listening to this must realise how serious this offending is. 'You made your position worse. You pretended to call and ambulance and stole items from him. It was a particularly callous thing to do to a man who lying bleeding towards fatality.' Judge Carey added: 'I am not going to make any comment about Grindr - about people who are willing to take in others they hardly know and have relations with them when drugs have been smoked. It doesn't assist anyone but it is a pretty shocking state of affairs.' Dunn, who has now been jailed for 12 years over the attack, called himself Gypsy Boy on the dating app . Dunn, who had previously been to Mr Garrod's home for a sex session, said in evidence he had 'memory blank' after being injected with Mephedrone. During his evidence he told the court he went to see Mr Garrod because he knew he could get drugs and sex. He said: 'At some point I had a glass of water and a couple of cigarettes. He tied my arm with an elastic thing he had and waited for my vein to come up, and he injected. 'I immediately felt really strange, like I wanted to be sick and like I don't know what I was doing. 'The last thing I remember him saying to me was: "Just sit up straight and don't panic". The next thing I remember is waking up in my bed at about 4pm. I don't remember how I got home.' Asked if he caused the wound, he replied: 'I can't answer that.' During his trial at Maidstone Crown Court Deborah Charles, prosecuting said Dunn had pretended to call an ambulance after the attack. She said: 'Mr Garrod felt as if someone had slapped him in the neck. 'He put his hand up to his neck and realised it was covered in blood. He never saw the weapon coming towards him. It happened too quickly. 'He just thought the defendant was leaning towards him, perhaps to kiss him or carry on what they were doing. 'Mr Garrod was begging him to call an ambulance. Mr Dunn pretended to do just that. He pretended to make a call and said an ambulance was coming. 'Mr Garrod was left lying on the bed with a wound that was life threatening.' At the time of the alleged attack Mr Garrod was living with a friend with whom he had previously been in a relationship. Miss Charles said Mr Garrod had spent the previous night with another man before meeting Dunn on the dating app. When Dunn arrived at his home he was said to have brought a drug with him which they both took. The court heard Mr Garrod regularly used a drug called Tina, a type of crystal meth, for sexual encounters.

Article:
Sportsmail's Derek Lawrenson gives his predictions ahead of the 79th Masters at Augusta on Thursday. Best American . So many to choose from but given Augusta’s predilection for a tale of redemption — from Vijay ‘kiss my ass’ Singh to Adam ‘this one’s for you, Greg’ Scott — let’s go for the reformed party animal Dustin Johnson. Time for him to prove he can match his gargantuan yardage off the tee with the requisite amount of brain cells. Dustin Johnson watches his tee shot during a practice round on the Augusta course on Wednesday . Best European (Non-UK) Not so many to choose from, alas. Indeed, given Henrik Stenson spent a week in bed with flu recently and reckons his strength is still low, we’re almost empty-handed. Still, let’s hope the Swede can rise from his sick bed. Other than that, it’s time Victor Dubuisson returned to the limelight. Henrik Stenson has only recently recovered from flu but the Swede will be hoping to mount a serious challenge . Best from the UK . Let’s leave out the history man on the grounds he has his own category. Lee Westwood has got an impressive recent record at Augusta and Justin Rose has shown he can play well here. But I have a feeling Paul Casey is the most likely to join Rory and get into contention come Sunday afternoon. Best International . You can hardly have faith in Adam Scott to emulate Bubba Watson and win a second Masters in three years given he’s confused enough on the greens to be going back to the long putter. While Scott sorts himself out, compatriot Jason Day has an outstanding chance to grab another win for Australia. Jason Day has a great chance to become another Australian winner at the Masters . Best each way bet . When you think last year’s joint runner-up Jonas Blixt is 150-1, there are some tasty odds out there. How about Padraig Harrington at 80-1? Or Bernhard Langer to finish in the top six at 400-1? My particular favourite is three-time Masters champ Phil Mickelson at 25-1. A steal. Phil Mickelson watches his fairway shot on the 11th green during his practice round on Wednesday . How will Rory do? Given what it would do for the sport and what an achievement it would represent, I fervently hope Bubba Watson is slipping a size 38 regular jacket on to McIlroy’s shoulders come Sunday night. But this might prove the major where he falls just short — and we have to wait a couple of years to enjoy his Slam. Prediction: Third . Rory McIlroy will begin his quest for a Grand Slam when the Masters kicks into action on Thursday . How will Tiger do? Not as good as some American writers believe, who are fitting him up for his fifth green jacket already on the strength of shooting 33 for the front nine on a practice round on Monday. Not as bad as the doomsayers think either, though. He should make the halfway cut… and maybe scrape into the top 20. Prediction: 19th . Tiger Woods was joined by his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn (left) and his two children on the course on Wednesday .

Summary 1: Derek Lawrenson's predictions for the 79th Masters at Augusta include a focus on Dustin Johnson's potential, as well as European players like Henrik Stenson and Victor Dubuisson. He also suggests that UK player Paul Casey could join Rory in contention. Lawrenson's comprehensive analysis covers various players and their odds in the tournament.

We are used to seeing celebrities airbrushed to perfection but this weekend two fabulous famous females have spoken out about their normal bodies. Model Chrissy Teigen proudly showed off her stretch marks in an Instagram post that has been praised by her fans. And the singer Pink hit back at critics who fat shamed her for an outfit she wore to a recent charity event alongside her husband Carey Hart. Scroll down for video . Model Chrissy Teigen was praised this week as she posted a picture of herself to Instagram showing off her stretch marks . Chrissy's fans were happy that she shared the picture, with one of them commenting that 'real women' have stretch marks . Chrissy, 29, posted the picture of her thighs which had clear stretch marks on them saying: 'Bruises from bumping kitchen drawer handles for a week. Stretchies say hi!' She received praise from many fans, such as Instagram user @saraelizabef  who said: 'Love it! Real women have stretch marks #respect'. Another follower, @emmalittle5, commented: 'I have so much respect for you! I have stretchies too and I appreciate someone being real about them and acknowledging them thanks.' Meanwhile, Pink took to Twitter to speak out against those who had commented on her weight at an event she attended to support a doctor friend. She said: 'I can see that some of you are concerned about me from your comments about my weight. 'You’re referring to the pictures of me from last night’s cancer benefit that I attended to support my dear friend Dr Maggie DiNome. The singer Pink hit back at those who criticised her weight at an event recently, saying that she was happy with her body . In a message posted to her Twitter account Pink jokingly referred to herself as 'cheesecake' and said that she felt beautiful in her dress . She continued: 'She was given the Duke Award for her tireless efforts and stellar contributions to the eradication of cancer. But unfortunately, my weight seems much more important to some of you. 'While I admit that the dress didn’t photograph as well as it did in my kitchen, I will also admit that I felt very pretty. In fact, I feel beautiful. 'So, my good and concerned peoples, please don’t worry about me. I’m not worried about me. And I’m not worried about you either:)… . 'I am perfectly fine, perfectly happy, and my healthy, voluptuous and crazy strong body is having some much deserved time off. Thanks for your concern. Love, cheesecake.' And Chrissy and Pink aren't the first stars to make comments about their bodies or to be keen to show off their more natural selves. Kelly Clarkson recently gave an interview to Ellen DeGeneres in which she said that she was used to being bullied about her weight . Recently Kelly Clarkson gave an interview to American chat show host Ellen DeGeneres in which she discussed how she had been facing criticism for her weight for years. She said: 'I’m such a creative person that I yo yo. So sometimes I’m more fit and I get into kickboxing hardcore. And then sometimes I don’t and I’m like.. I’d rather have wine.' 'We are who we are. Whatever size,' Kelly told Ellen, prompting applause from the studio audience. 'You know, if it’s you, you’re just like whatever,' she said. 'I think what hurts my feelings..... is that I’ll have a meet and greet after the show and a girl who is, like, bigger than me will be in the meet and greet and be like, 'wow, if they think you’re big, I must be so fat to them.' In 2012 Girls star and producer Lena Dunham hit back after she was criticised for wearing a pair of short shorts on the red carpet. In 2012 Lena Dunham recieved harsh criticism for this outfit. She said she didn't think a thinner woman would have been criticised in the same way . Lena told her critics: 'I am going to live to be 100, and I am going to show my thighs every day till I die.' She said at the time: 'Last week I wore something to an event...a big top and little shorts, and a bunch of [blog posts] came out that I had been out without pants [trousers],' 'I actually saw it...'Love it or hate it: The no-pants look.' My mom...thought it was so funny. 'My boyfriend was like, 'People seem to be worked up about you going out without pants.' But I didn't go out without pants! I had shorts on.' Lena continued: 'If Olivia Wilde had gone to a party in...little shorts, she might have been on a 'weird dressed list' or been told her outfit was cute. 'I don't think a girl with tiny thighs would have received such no-pants attention. I think what it really was...'Why did you all make us look at your thighs?' 'My response is, get used to it because I am going to live to be 100, and I am going to show my thighs every day till I die.' Tyra Banks' weight has gone up and down over the years and the model says that anyone who doesn't like the way she looks can kiss her fat a** . Former supermodel Tyra Banks similarly hit back after she was subject to mean remarks about her fuller figure. She said: 'To all of you that have something nasty to say about me, or other women that are built like me, women that sometimes or all the time look like this, women whose names you know, women whose names you don't, women who have been picked on, women whose husbands put them down, women at work or girls in school — I have one thing to say to you. Kiss my fat a**!' In 2014 when she was criticised for her appearance at the Golden Globes actress Gabourey Sidibe had the perfect response to her haters. She said: 'To the people making mean comments about my [Golden Globes] pics, I mos def cried about it on that private jet on the way to my dream job last night #jk.'

Article:
Ed Miliband was accused of plunging the General Election campaign to a ‘new low’ last night by ‘weaponising dead migrants’. The Labour leader and his party’s spin machine prompted the most bitter row of the campaign so far by suggesting that David Cameron bore personal responsibility for drownings of refugees in the Mediterranean. Senior Conservatives claimed Mr Miliband was effectively ‘accusing the Prime Minister of murder’ in a ‘desperate and negative’ attempt to score political points by exploiting a human tragedy. Ed Miliband, pictured, was accused of trying to make political capital from the Mediterranean tragedy . Ed Miliband claimed the Mediterranean crisis was 'in part a direct result' of the PM's Libya policy . The controversy began after Labour spin doctors issued a briefing note which said Mr Miliband would use a speech on foreign policy to say the ‘tragic scenes’ in the Mediterranean were ‘in part a direct result’ of Mr Cameron’s Libya policy. The Labour leader later insisted he was not saying Mr Cameron had ‘blood on his hands’, but was making a ‘very important point about post-conflict planning in Libya’ after the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi. The Prime Minister said only that Mr Miliband’s remarks were ‘ill- judged’. But a senior Tory source said: ‘A few bad polls for Labour after a poor week of campaigning and Ed Miliband accuses the PM of murder. I think we can see who is getting desperate and running a negative and personal campaign.’ Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg also condemned Labour’s intervention, pointing out that Mr Miliband had backed Western military involvement in Libya. He accused Labour of astonishing hypocrisy, given the catastrophic failure of post-war planning in its Iraq conflict. Mr Clegg told BBC Radio 5 live: ‘I think it is quite distasteful, actually, to reduce this total human tragedy of hundreds of people dying out in the Mediterranean to a political point-scoring blame game, particularly, I have to say, from a party that of course brought us into an illegal invasion in Iraq where there was no planning at all for the aftermath.’ Mr Clegg said there should be ‘a little more adherence to the facts as to who is ending up on these boats, why they are and what we can do about it to stop this terrible human tragedy’. Former foreign secretary William Hague said Mr Miliband’s remarks represented ‘a new low in shallow opportunism’, given that the Labour leader had said ‘nothing’ about foreign policy for five years. Former Tory minister Richard Benyon accused Mr Miliband of ‘weaponising dead migrants’. He said a large percentage of those fleeing North Africa ‘come from other countries than Libya so Miliband is wrong on every level’. And former defence secretary Liam Fox said: ‘Having tried to weaponise the NHS, Miliband is trying to weaponise drowning migrants. It’s quite offensive and reflects extremely badly on both him and his party.’ Mr Miliband, speaking at the Chatham House think-tank in London, was forced to deny that he had ‘politicised’ a tragedy. Former defence secretary Liam Fox said Miliband was trying to 'weaponise drowning migrants' Asked if that was true, Mr Miliband replied: ‘Nonsense. No. Look, what this is about is saying very clearly to the British people that there is a huge issue we face as a country which is learning the lessons of the 2003 Iraq War. ‘The problem is that in relation to Libya we have repeated the mistake because we haven’t done the post-conflict planning. ‘I think people should just read my words and I don’t think anybody in the foreign policy community or in the wider international community would disagree with what I’ve said about the failure of post-conflict planning.’ Labour aides pointed out that Mr Miliband did raise the issue of post-war plans after supporting bombing raids in Libya in 2011. But footage of him also emerged from the same year suggesting the new Libyan authorities should be left to get on with it. ‘This is an important moment to recognise the National Transitional Council and their role in taking Libya forward, and we’ve got to be led by them. It’s very important that Libyans determine their future,’ he said at the time. Labour’s shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker was forced to concede that Mr Cameron is not responsible for migrant deaths in the Mediterranean. ‘Nobody would want to say that the Prime Minister, as a human being, would want to see the terrible things we have seen in the Med,’ he said. In a bruising interview with the BBC’s Andrew Neil, Mr Coaker also struggled to explain when Mr Miliband had raised ‘consistent concerns’ about the issue of post-conflict planning. A senior Labour source said the party ‘did not resile from anything’ in its briefing note and accused critics of a ‘silly, utterly spurious’ response to a ‘serious speech’. Labour accused the Tories of ‘personal attacks’ earlier in the campaign, when Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mr Miliband ‘stabbed his brother in the back’ in the party’s 2010 leadership contest.

Summary 1: Labour's Ed Miliband is criticised for politicising the Mediterranean migrant crisis, implying David Cameron's personal responsibility due to his Libya policy. Miliband, speaking at the Chatham House think-tank, denies this, highlighting post-conflict planning failures, a lesson from the 2003 Iraq War. Nick Clegg condemns Labour's intervention, noting Miliband's support for Libya's National Transitional Council and Labour's own post-war planning failures.

Summary 2: Ed Miliband, criticised for politicising the Mediterranean migrant crisis, denies implying David Cameron's personal responsibility due to his Libya policy. Speaking at Chatham House, Miliband cites post-conflict planning failures, referencing the 2003 Iraq War and his support for bombing raids in Libya. Nick Clegg condemns Labour's stance, while Labour's Vernon Coaker admits Cameron isn't responsible for migrant deaths, in an interview with Andrew Neil.

Summary 3: Ed Miliband, Labour leader, faces criticism for allegedly politicising the Mediterranean migrant crisis, implying Prime Minister David Cameron's personal responsibility. Critics argue Miliband is exploiting tragedy for political points, while he insists he's highlighting Cameron's ineffective Libya policy and post-conflict planning. Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, condemns Labour's intervention, citing Miliband's support for Western military involvement in Libya and Labour's own post-war planning failures.

Summary 4: This article discusses a controversy involving Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, who has been accused of exploiting the Mediterranean migrant crisis for political gain. Critics, including senior Conservatives, suggest that Miliband is implying that Prime Minister David Cameron is personally responsible for the drownings of refugees in the Mediterranean. Miliband, however, insists that he is merely highlighting the importance of post-conflict planning in Libya, a policy he believes Cameron has failed to implement effectively.

Article:
Greece warned it will go bankrupt next week after failing to stump up enough cash to pay millions of public sector workers and its international debts. Deputy finance minister Dimitras Mardas set alarm bells ringing yesterday when he declared the country had been 'running on empty' since February. With a debt repayment deadline looming on May 1, Greece faces the deeply damaging prospect of having to snub its own employees to make a €200m payment to the International Monetary Fund. In a sign of the bleak climate engulfing the country, Greece's biggest tax office had its electricity cut off yesterday after the finance ministry failed to pay its power bills. At a summit in Brussels today, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is expected to appeal to German Chancellor Angela Merkel for more aid to avoid going bust and a potential exit from the euro. Dire straights: Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras arrives at an European Union leaders summit in Brussels as the country warned it was on the verge of bankruptcy with salary and debt repayment looming . Mardas caused consternation by saying Greece was about €350-400m short of funds needed this month to pay salaries and pensions that are due at the end of the month. But two hours later, he said the money had been found from social security funds and state corporations not listed on the stock exchange that would put their reserves in a Bank of Greece account. EU leaders fear the left-wing Syriza government will choose its workers, potentially pushing it out of the Eurozone and landing Europe with yet another crisis, it was reported by The Times. At a meeting today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was expected to press Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to move faster to agree detailed economic reforms crucial to unlock international bailout funds before Athens runs out of cash. The conservative German leader was due to meet the leftist Greek premier a day before eurozone finance ministers meet in Riga to review progress -- or the lack of it -- in slow-moving negotiations between Athens and its creditors. EU officials said they expected Merkel to deliver a message that she wants to keep Greece in the single currency area and avoid a catastrophic default. EU leaders fear Mr Tsipras's left-wing Syriza government will choose to pay its workers than its IMF creditors, risking a default that potentially pushes it out of the Eurozone and lands Europe with yet another crisis . But to achieve that, Tsipras's government must make commitments in technical talks on detailed, costed measures to make public finances sustainable. 'At the highest level, the Germans want to keep Greece in the euro area and find a solution, but time is running short and there may have to be more drama before Tsipras can put his foot down and reach an agreement,' one senior official said. A Greek government official told Reuters in Athens that Tsipras would outline specific reforms to Merkel in a bid to appease creditors and is hoping she will intervene so that there is a breakthrough in the negotiations. The chancellor has so far insisted it is up to Athens to satisfy representatives of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, speaking in Berlin, said there were increasing doubts about the situation in Greece, warning that if financial instability returned, there would be no economic growth this year. He said he no longer expected an accord this month but negotiations could run beyond an April 30 deadline for a deal and he expected agreement sometime during May. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was expected to press Greek PM Alexis Tsipras to move faster to agree detailed economic reforms crucial to unlock international bailout funds before Athens runs out of cash . UEFA's general secretary Gianni Infantino has warned that there will be no choice but to suspend Greece from international football unless the country's government rescinds proposed new laws. The Greek government has put forward a bill which could see sporting events cancelled due to incidents of crowd violence and teams prohibited from playing in European competition. UEFA and FIFA say that is direct government interference in football and have threatened to suspend Greece. Infantino said: 'Sadly there will be no other choice than to suspend the Greek Football Federation if this new legislation is passed because football does not allow government interference. 'There are currently three other countries, outside of Europe, which are currently facing similar issues - Indonesia, Pakistan and Zimbabwe. 'I think people in Greece should be very concerned because a suspension will have a serious impact on their football. Don't forget that it will affect more than the national team. If your clubs don't play in our competitions, their coefficient will also drop, meaning that less teams can qualify for the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League.' UEFA and FIFA sent a final letter of warning on Wednesday but the Greek government is refusing to back down. Greece's deputy sports minister Stavros Kontonis told Greek television on Wednesday night: 'We are not going to change the philosophy of the sports bill. The supervision exercised in Greek football by FIFA and UEFA has failed.' Given its tight cash position, Greece had reasons to speed up the talks and its reform plans. 'Progress is not good,' he told ARD German television. Greece has yet to agree with its partners on a comprehensive list of reforms to secure €7.2billion remaining from its €240billion EU/IMF bailout. Despite concerns raised yesterday, Eurozone and Greek officials indicated that Athens could probably scrape together public cash reserves to meet its payment obligations into June. But it faces a hump of bond redemptions to the ECB in July and August that it cannot meet without a fresh injection of funds. The ECB's chief economist, Peter Praet, said the central bank was prepared to keep authorising emergency lending to Greek banks for now because they were assessed to be solvent. 'It is true that it is a stressful situation,' Praet said at an event in Berlin. 'I'm not going to discuss how long this will go on. Verbal discipline is of the essence in crisis times.' Tsipras, elected in January on an anti-austerity platform, is resisting cutting pensions, liberalising the labour market or raising value-added tax on Greek holiday islands. EU officials said Brussels was pressing Athens to move ahead with other measures, such as a radical shake-up of product and service markets to sweep away privileges and protections for vested interests, . It also called for greater fairness in taxation to shift the burden to the better-off and improve collection. They are also looking for progress on privatisations, which leftist ministers halted when they took office in late January. Tsipras's office said he would also have a private meeting with French President Francois Hollande on the summit sidelines. Greek daily Kathimerini reported that Athens is considering asking the euro zone's rescue fund to buy Greek government bonds held by the ECB to pay for debt redemptions due this summer. 'The aim of the government's plan is to have the European Stability Mechanism buy the bonds and reach a deal to repay them further out in time, as is the case with loans from the EFSF (European Financial Stability Facility),' the paper said without citing sources. That would amount to a third Greek bailout requiring euro zone governments' agreement and parliamentary approval in some countries, such as Germany and Finland, which could only be achieved if there were a deal on a comprehensive reform package.

Summary 1: Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is expected to appeal to German Chancellor Angela Merkel for aid as Greece faces bankruptcy. Deputy Finance Minister Dimitras Mardas revealed Greece is €350-400m short of funds needed for salaries and pensions, but later stated the money had been found from social security funds.

Summary 2: Facing bankruptcy, Greece's PM Alexis Tsipras appeals to German Chancellor Angela Merkel for aid. Greece, €350-400m short of funds, found money in social security funds. Tsipras must agree to economic reforms to unlock €7.2billion from an EU/IMF bailout. The ECB continues emergency lending.

Summary 3: This article discusses the financial crisis in Greece, which is on the brink of bankruptcy. The country is struggling to pay its international debts and public sector workers. The situation is so dire that the country's largest tax office had its electricity cut off due to unpaid bills.

Summary 4: Greece's Deputy Finance Minister, Dimitras Mardas, warns of impending bankruptcy as the country struggles to make a €200m payment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is expected to appeal for more aid to avoid a potential exit from the euro.

Arrest: Timothy Rogalski allegedly repeatedly called Sandy Hook Elementary School on Tuesday . A man has been arrested for repeatedly calling Sandy Hook Elementary School and accusing staff members of staging the 2012 school massacre. Timothy Rogalski, from Wallingford, Connecticut, called the school on Tuesday morning and left four messages on its office answerphone. The fifth time he called, he spoke to an administrative assistant. In the calls, the 30-year-old accused staff of being behind the December 14, 2012 shooting that left 20 children and six female educators dead, according to police in Monroe. He also said the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2014 were fake, police said. Authorities traced the calls back to the home Rogalski shares with his father, about 40 miles from where the 2012 attack unfolded, and he was arrested. 'I don't think I said anything that horrible,' Rogalski said at a court appearance on Wednesday, NBC Connecticut reported. He has been charged with harassment and disorderly conduct and is being held on $2,500 bond. He was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation and not to contact anyone at the school. He will next appear in court on April 22. Arrest: The calls were traced to his home in Wallingford, pictured, which is about 40 miles from where the shooting unfolded in Newtown in 2012. He was taken into custody and charged . Rogalski allegedly made the calls to Sandy Hook Elementary, which is operating temporarily in Monroe as a new school is built to replace the old one, and two other nearby schools. The original site of the school was demolished a year after the shootings. The gunman's home, where he shot dead his mother before going on the killing spree at the school, was also torn down in earlier this year. Rogalski's arrest does not mark the first time threatening calls have been made about the killings. In the days following the 2012 school shooting, Wilfrido Cardenas Hoffman, 31, looked up Newtown residents' phone numbers from his home in Venezuela and made more than 90 calls. Authorities said that in a few calls, Cardenas claimed to be the Sandy Hook shooter, Adam Lanza, and threatened to kill the person he had phoned. Terror: Responders gather at the scene of the mass school shooting in Newtown on December 14, 2012. The shooting left 20 children and six educators dead, as well as the gunman's mother . 'This is Adam Lanza. I'm gonna (expletive) kill you. You're dead. You're dead. You hear me? You're dead,' he said, according to authorities. Deirdre Daly, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, said the conduct of Cardenas was reprehensible. 'These threatening calls, just two days after the tragedy, compounded the collective suffering of all of the citizens of Newtown and needlessly stressed law enforcement resources at a critical time,' she said. He was arrested in 2014, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year in prison.

Summary 1: This article discusses the arrest of a man named Timothy Rogalski, who is accused of repeatedly calling Sandy Hook Elementary School. He allegedly left messages accusing the school staff of staging the 2012 school massacre. The calls were traced back to his home and he was subsequently arrested. The school is currently operating temporarily in Monroe as a new school is being built to replace the old one.

Summary 2: Timothy Rogalski was arrested after allegedly accusing Sandy Hook Elementary School staff of staging the 2012 massacre and the Boston Marathon bombings. Traced calls led to his arrest and he faces harassment and disorderly conduct charges. The school, temporarily in Monroe, is replacing the original demolished site. Rogalski is ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation.

Summary 3: Timothy Rogalski, accused of falsely accusing Sandy Hook Elementary and two other schools' staff of staging the 2012 massacre and Boston Marathon bombings, was arrested, held on a $2,500 bond, and ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation. His next court appearance is April 22. Previously, Wilfrido Cardenas Hoffman made 90 threatening calls, claiming to be shooter Adam Lanza.

Sarah added: ‘We think you all need to go for choir practice.’ Andrew, however, was content with the gesture. ‘Having been told this was a bad idea, it worked,’ he said. The Prince, who used a Pitch@Palace event last year to send the first royal selfie, joked: ‘’What was it somebody said about children and dogs?’ The social media-savy Royal is also the only senior working royal to have his own personal Twitter account.

Article:
A keen fisherman got more than he bargained for at the weekend when he reeled in a massive shark after spending hours battling the beast. Max Muggeridge, 19, from Coomera in QLD was camping at Tweed Heads just across the NSW border with his girlfriend when the pair decided to go for an early morning fish. An avid angler, Mr Muggeridge couldn't believe his luck when a huge four metre tiger shark took a bite of his line, and he spent the next three hours trying to bring it to shore. Scroll down for video . Max Muggeridge, 19, from the Gold Coast caught this four metre tiger shark at the weekend . He reeled in the monster on the Tweed coast just inside the NSW border, after a three hour battle . The massive creature is one of the largest tiger sharks ever caught off a beach, according to Max . 'Three hours on the rod and reel, it was both physically and mentally exhausting,' Mr Muggeridge told Daily Mail Australia. 'It definitely challenged my mindset and whether I had the perseverance to push through,' he added. 'We were just about to reel our rods in.. I started my car up and then my rod started ticking over.' The teenager, who is in his own words 'a shark conservationist first and foremost', also said the massive three hour battle left him with some serious battle wounds. 'I was absolutely shattered, I had blood blisters all over my hands, I've got some nice callouses coming up now,' Mr Muggeridge revealed. From the time he hooked the shark just after 7am, to the time he pulled it in around 10.30am the fisherman said it was a constant battle. In a post on Facebook, he described the ordeal in great detail, admitting that at times he wasn't sure if he had the strength to reel the monster in. 'The first hour this shark absolutely made a mockery out of me,' Mr Muggeridge wrote. The huge struggle with the shark left his antique fishing rod bent slightly out of shape . The 19-year-old said the catch was a once in a lifetime opportunity . Mr Muggeridge believes it could have been world record size but he wasn't able to accurately measure the beast . He was with his girlfriend Alexia (right) on the beach, who was snapping photos of him reeling in the shark . 'I was hurting bad, really bad. I've never been in so much pain. Sun burning in my face, shocking burns and blisters all over my hands, sweat and sunscreen dripping into my eyes, and my whole body aching from holding the intense pressure for such an extended time. 'Thoughts crossed my head like I can't do this, It's too big, I'm not prepared enough, I'm on my own...' the post continued. Mr Muggeridge said he didn't even get a proper glimpse of the shark until the second hour, 'when it jumped out of the water!!! What a sight, I have never seen that before!' The teenager also spoke to Nine's Today show on Thursday morning, telling the program he knew what he was up for about '20 seconds in... it definitely shocked me and my girlfriend (who) I was fishing with'. 'It absolutely blew everything I've ever caught out of the water so it was once in a lifetime catch,' he added. Mr Muggeridge said he thinks the catch could have been close to the world record, and he wished he could have measured it accurately. 'The current catch and release world record tiger shark held by Joey Polk is 10 foot eight inches (3.25m) in fork length and 12 foot 9 inches (3.88m) overall length,' he told The Gold Coast Bulletin. After getting a quick measurement of the huge creature, Mr Muggeridge sent it back out to sea . He is pictured here watching the huge creature swim back out into the ocean . Mr Muggeridge (left) and Alexia (right) were camping on the Tweed coast when they were fishing . Mr Muggeridge said he decided to release the shark rather than getting the measurements necessary to prove the record because the animal was in distressed after being landed. Photos show the young man in the shallows with the creature, dwarfed by the huge tiger shark. Snapped by his girlfriend Alexia, Mr Muggeridge said she was taking photos of him while he worked to get the marine animal back in the water and out to safety. He described the catch as a life-long goal, and said that by the end of the struggle he was completely wiped out. 'I collapsed on the beach and tried taking it all in. I had just achieved everything I had ever set out to. It was surreal. The time was 10.30am, meaning I was on the rod and reel for over 3 hours,' Mr Muggeridge posted. Aside from the exhaustion, and battle wounds the teenager also bent his antique rod during the fight, but said he wouldn't change it for anything. Asked about the danger of being in such close proximity to a potentially deadly creature, Mr Muggeridge said he wasn't too concerned. 'You take your chances, I've been around enough sharks to have a basic understanding of how they work,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'But at the end of the day you are dealing with a wild animal.' Max celebrates his catch, and its successful return to the sea .

Summary 1: Max Muggeridge, a shark conservationist, battled a potential world record size tiger shark from 7am to 10.30am at Tweed Heads. Using an antique rod, he and his girlfriend Alexia endured physical exhaustion and battle wounds to reel in the four-metre beast. Achieving a life-long goal, he released the shark back to the sea.

Summary 2: While camping with his girlfriend Alexia, shark conservationist Max Muggeridge caught a potential world record size tiger shark at Tweed Heads. After a strenuous three-hour battle using an antique fishing rod, he successfully reeled in the four-metre beast. Despite the shark's size, he chose to release it back to the sea, prioritising its wellbeing over a potential record.

Summary 3: Max Muggeridge, a 19-year-old shark conservationist, caught a four-metre tiger shark during a camping trip at Tweed Heads with his girlfriend Alexia. After a gruelling three-hour battle, he managed to reel in the beast, marking it as one of the largest ever caught off a beach. Despite the physical and mental exhaustion, he described the experience as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Summary 4: This article discusses the story of a young man named Max Muggeridge who had an extraordinary fishing experience. While camping at Tweed Heads, he managed to catch a massive tiger shark.

We all joke about how bad school dinners are but a secondary school in China takes this age old gripe to another level. In protest at their 'horrible' school meals, high school students in north east China's Jilin province are being forced to the sidewalk everyday to eat their lunch. With teachers banning packed lunches and erecting barbed wire and metal sheeting to prevent smuggling, the students' only option is to leave school grounds to eat everyday, the People's Daily Online reports. A group of students eat their lunch together at a local street vendor near the school premises . Left, a group of students eat their lunch while sitting on the sidewalk. Right, they make their way back to class after being forced to leave the school grounds to eat . Pictures of large groups of students sitting on the kerb eating their lunch have spread rapidly across Wechat, China's version of Whatsapp. According to students, their school banned all pre-packed lunches and cut their lunch break from one hour to 30 minutes, forcing students to eat their lunch outside on the street. Students claim food cooked in the school canteen is simply too horrible to eat, and it is so bad that at one point the canteen even closed down. The school has resorted to drastic measures to keep out students who may try to smuggle in food by putting up barbed wire and metal sheeting to block off the back entrance. The school canteen also fought back by only serving staff - but they are continuing to sell lunch boxes at 10 yuan a piece which the school recommends the students buy. And in a further effort to make eating outside of the school more difficult, street vendors are banned from operating outside of its gates. The images attracted thousands of comments on various Chinese websites. One person, from Jiangsu, said the schools were 'only after money'. Others also questioned those who were in charge of the greatly-despised canteen, including the school's headmaster, who was branded 'shameless'. The school has banned students from bringing food onto the premises and has even erected barbed wire and metal sheeting to prevent smuggling at its back entrance .

What would you get if one of the Queen's corgis ran off with one of Sir Ranulph Fiennes's Siberian huskies and had a puppy? A corgski, of course, just like Max. At just 18.5in from foot to shoulder, this diminutive fellow looks as if he was the runt of his litter. He is, in fact, a fully grown husky-corgi cross. But, unbelievably, Max has been abandoned and he's looking for a home. He's become a favourite with workers at the Dogs Trust in Basildon, Essex, who have been looking after him since he was found. Max (pictured) is a 18.5in high fully-grown husky corgi cross. After being abandoned, he has now taken refuge at the Dogs Trust in Basildon, Essex . Huskies, such as the one pictured, have become increasingly popular due to shows such as Game of Thrones . Pictured is a typical Welsh corgi. Max is part corgi, part husky, and is looking for a new home . 'It quickly became apparent that he was the epitome of the saying good things come in small packages,' says the Trust's Sam Davis. 'He caught the eye of our staff when he arrived, but as he was found as a stray, little is known about his life before.' Max is described as gentle, intelligent and big-hearted. There are currently 54 other wolf-like breeds being cared for by the charity's network of animal rehousing centres. The Trust is in no doubt that the trend is partly due to fans wanting to follow the stars of Game Of Thrones and Twilight, which have popularised wolf-like dogs such as Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian huskies. But many new owners are often unprepared to cope with the specific exercise and socialisation requirements of these breeds – and make a lifetime commitment to them – resulting in a significant number eventually being abandoned.

Summary 1: Max, a diminutive husky-corgi cross, was abandoned and is now housed at the Dogs Trust in Basildon, Essex. Sam Davis from the Trust praises Max's gentle and intelligent nature. The Trust, which also cares for 54 other wolf-like breeds including Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian huskies, attributes their popularity to shows like Game Of Thrones. Despite the challenges, Max remains a favorite among the shelter's staff.

Summary 2: This article discusses a unique dog named Max, who is a husky-corgi cross. Max, despite being fully grown, is only 18.5 inches tall. He was found and is currently being cared for by the Dogs Trust in Basildon, Essex. Unfortunately, Max was abandoned and is now in need of a new home. The article also mentions that Max has become a favorite among the workers at the Dogs Trust.

Summary 3: Max, a husky-corgi cross, stands at only 18.5 inches tall. He was abandoned and is now under the care of the Dogs Trust in Basildon, Essex. The popularity of wolf-like breeds, like Max, has surged due to shows like Game Of Thrones. The Dogs Trust is currently caring for 54 other dogs of similar breeds. Despite his small size, Max has won the hearts of the workers at the shelter.

Summary 4: Max, a small husky-corgi cross, was abandoned and now resides at the Dogs Trust in Basildon, Essex. Sam Davis of the Trust commends Max's gentle, intelligent nature. The Trust, also home to 54 other wolf-like breeds, links their popularity to shows like Game Of Thrones and Twilight. However, many owners are unprepared for these breeds' exercise and socialisation needs, leading to abandonment. Despite this, Max remains a staff favorite.

An Indian-style bungalow that was built in Sussex in the Victorian era and preserved to maintain its 1880s facade has gone on the market for £1million. Pleasaunce Cottage in Dormans Park near East Grinstead has been lovingly upheld to how its first owners intended it in the 19th Century. With wood paneling on indoor ceilings and a large veranda at its front, the unique property is one of the first ever bungalows built in the country. It has gone on the market for £985,000, with historians eager to put it forward for listing to further protect its heritage. Pleasaunce Cottage in Dormans Park in East Grinstead has gone on sale for almost £1million. The property is one of the last surviving bungalows in Britain that were built on the design of Victorian houses in India . An early photograph of the house shows how it has been lovingly preserved by its owners since its construction in the late 19th Century . Inside, original oak panelling adorns the ceilings and walls. The double height living room is one of the house's main features with a quirky gallery serving as a make-shift office . A sketch of the property's main sitting room shows how its Victorian design has been maintained to how architects originally intended it . Built in the 1880s by RA Briggs, known as Bungalow Briggs, the property is not all split over one level as modern bungalows are today. At the time the term was used to describe small, country homes used by the wealthy upper classes as a retreat to escape the heat of pulsing Indian cities. The design soon infiltrated British architecture. Briggs, a renowned architect, published his interpretation of the style in the 1891 book Bungalows and Country Residences. A hallmark of the traditional Indian-Victorian bungalow was a large veranda at the front of a property like the one found at Pleasaunce Cottage. Set over 2,542sq ft, the house has four bedrooms, four reception rooms and a cellar. The main sitting room is double height with a gallery and the original inglenook fireplace. Its current owner has lived in the property for more than 30 years, having bought the house in 1983. Unlike bungalows as they are referred to today, the property is set over three levels. The original term was not exclusive to one-storey properties, instead referring to mountain retreats favoured by the Upper Classes . An architect's drawing of the property in the 20th Century. Historians are eager to put the house forward for listing to further protect its heritage . One of the house's most distinct features is its large veranda at the front. These were a common feature among Victorian properties in India . The house's current owner said she fell in love with its unique design and layout when she bought it in 1983 and has tried to preserve its character . Other unique features which make the property so notable are two stained glass windows that have Victorian messages inscribed on them . One of the four bedrooms in the house that is set over more than 2,000sq ft. Original oak and wood flooring has been maintained . The property has four bedrooms, four reception rooms and two bathrooms, one of which is en-suite. It is being sold for £985,000 . 'It’s a great place, I fell in love with it 32 years ago and I still love it after all these years,' said Marian Parker, 60. 'The big drawing room is double height and has this little gallery which I use as a study. The room opens on to the veranda and is a lovely room with lots of light in summer but it also has an open fireplace and is really cosy in winter. 'It looks very different from the front to the back. From the front it looks like a normal bungalow but when you go round to the back it looks like a three-storey house because you can see the cellar.' With two stained glass windows and an original oak panelling in the hall and lounge, historians are eager to put the property forward to be listed. Dr Kathryn Ferry, an architectural historian and author of the book Bungalows, said: 'This is one of the earliest surviving bungalows in Britain and certainly one of the most important. 'What makes this one so significant is it was part of a bungalow settlement as if built in India on a hill station where the colonial British went to escape from the heat of the cities, sitting on their verandas in the cool breeze. 'There are a couple of bungalows in the development left but this one is the most original. 'Bungalows weren’t about single storey living, they were more of a leisure house and this exemplifies that. Bungalows aren’t just boring suburban homes. 'It is not listed but it ought to be. We can’t put it forward for listing yet in case it puts off buyers. But hopefully whoever does buy it will appreciate its importance enough to support a bid to list it.' The house is being sold  by Hamptons International for £985,000 and has not yet attracted any offers. A view of the property from one of its gardens. It is set over almost one acre of land in the Sussex countryside in East Grinstead . While the house is one of many of the same style built in the area by architect RA Briggs, historians have described it as one of the best remaining examples of a Victorian-Indian bungalow .

Summary 1: RA Briggs' Victorian-era bungalow, Pleasaunce Cottage in Sussex, is on sale for £1million. The four-bedroom property, owned by Marian Parker since 1983, features four reception rooms, a cellar, wood paneling, and a large veranda. Despite its bungalow label, it's a three-storey house.

Summary 2: Pleasaunce Cottage, a preserved Victorian-era bungalow in Sussex, is on sale for £1million. Built in the 1880s by RA Briggs, it's one of the UK's first bungalows, featuring wood paneling and a large veranda.

Harrowing images have emerged showing the seconds before a media activist was brutally murdered by militants loyal to the Islamic State in Syria. Taken on the frontline of fighting in the countryside outside the rebel-held city of Aleppo, the photos show a prisoner wearing an orange jumpsuit being forced to his knees before being shot. ISIS released the disturbing photographs on the same day as they bizarrely attempted to portray everyday life under the terror group's control as happy and carefree - distributing images of smiling farmers living near Aleppo who use Western technology to grow and harvest their abundant crops. Harrowing: Taken on the frontline of fighting in the countryside outside the rebel-held city of Aleppo, the photos show a prisoner wearing an orange jumpsuit being forced to his knees before being shot . The  new ISIS photographs show the activists just moments before he was shot at point blank range . Images of the media activist's brutal execution were released by ISIS' Halab Media Centre, which operates in and around the city of Aleppo and has previously released sickening images and videos of the terror organisation murdering anybody who dares to oppose them. Brave activists operating on the ground in Syria have been hugely successful in helping to unite and inspire a resistance against the terror group by sharing images and reports of their atrocities online. Groups such as Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, which operates in ISIS' de facto capital city, work undercover, secretly filming ISIS militants as they take part in near daily massacres. This has, however, made the activists a major target, with the terror group exacting bloody revenge on those found to be spreading information on their activities. Charged as spies, the campaigners face certain death - either by being shot at point-blank range or crucified in a public square. The activist seen in the latest ISIS photographs show him just moments before his 'execution'. The fact he was forced to his knees and the presence of men standing around him wielding assault rifles has led analysts to believe his death was almost certainly by shooting, even though his moment of death is not shown and there are no images of his body. Moments from death: With his arms tightly bound behind his back with plastic handcuffs, blurry images show the victim being dragged through a public square by his heavily armed captors . Strange: ISIS released the disturbing execution photographs on the same day as they bizarrely attempted to portray everyday life under the terror group's control as happy and carefree - distributing images of smiling farmers living near Aleppo who use Western technology to grow and harvest their abundant crops . ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorist group, according to an Iraqi source. The source said that he was wounded by an attack from the US-led coalition while travelling in a three-car convoy in March in Nineveh, Iraq. At first his chances of survival were deemed by his lieutenants to be low, but he pulled through. However, he was left so weakened that his inner circle reportedly mooted the idea of naming a new leader. He is slowly recovering but does not have the reins of the organisation, according to The Guardian . Two officials confirmed to the paper that the strike on the convoy did indeed take place, on March 18 in the al-Baaj district of Nineveh, not far from the Syrian border. One, a Western diplomat, told the paper that Coalition generals weren’t sure whether al-Baghdadi was in the convoy. With his arms tightly bound behind his back with plastic handcuffs, blurry images show the victim being dragged through a public square by his heavily armed captors. His name and the group he worked for are not known, but ISIS identified the man as a 'media activist' understood to have been murdered sometime earlier this week. The images emerged on the same day as ISIS made a bizarre attempt to portray themselves as a peace-loving group by distributing photos of smiling farmers harvesting their crops. Using Western-style crop-spraying equipment, a group of young men are seen in the fields happily picking cabbages while young boys load them on to the back of a lorry. The happy pastoral scene is in stark contrast to the campaign of rape and massacre ISIS has brought to vast stretches of the Syria and Iraq - where depraved extremists carry out daily atrocities in the name of the radical interpretation if Islam. The juxtaposing scenes emerged as Kurdish officials claimed ISIS militants were preparing for an attack on a city in north east Syria, near the border with Iraq, where the terror group remains a significant threat despite recent setbacks elsewhere in the two countries. Hasaka province in north east Syria is strategically important for all sides and borders ISIS-held territory in Iraq, where the group is back on the offensive after losing Tikrit earlier this month. Modern: Using Western-style crop-spraying equipment, a group of young men are seen in the fields happily picking cabbages while young boys load them on to the back of a lorry . At work: One the cabbages have been picked, young boys are seen loading them on to the back of a lorry . The Syrian Kurdish YPG militia has recorded significant victories against ISIS this year, driving it from the town of Kobane at the Turkish border and then taking two towns in Hasaka province with the help of a U.S.-led air campaign. But ISIS remains a danger, said Redur Xelil, YPG spokesman. Its targets include the provincial capital, Hasaka city, and the town of Tel Tamr, to the northwest. ISIS is still believed to be holding some 200 Assyrian Christians abducted in February from villages near Tel Tamr. 'South of Hasaka there are areas that Daesh controls entirely. There is a big Daesh mobilisation outside the city, and there are big fears of an attack on Hasaka city,' Xelil said in an interview from the city of Qamishli via Skype. Daesh is an Arabic name for ISIS, which calls itself Islamic State. For now, ISIS' priority is Tel Tamr, where it aims to cut a YPG supply route, he added. ISIS is 'trying to take big cities, to take the battle into cities' to mark it harder for the U.S.-led alliance to hit it, he said. The happy pastoral scene is in stark contrast to the campaign of rape and massacre ISIS has brought to vast stretches of the Syria and Iraq - where depraved extremists carry out atrocities in the name of  radical Islam . Claim: The news comes as ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) was reported to have been seriously injured in an airstrike. The militant is no longer in control of the terrorist group, according to an Iraqi source . Hasaka is home to many Syrians who have fled areas further west, including the country's second city Aleppo, Xelil said. The Syrian Observatory, which monitors the Syrian civil war, reports daily clashes between the YPG and ISIS fighters near Tel Tamr, and clashes between the Syrian military and ISIS in areas west and east of Hasaka city. The YPG has emerged as the only partner for the U.S.-led alliance bombing ISIS in Syria. But its effectiveness is greatly diminished beyond areas where the Kurds have set up autonomous zones since Syria's conflict erupted in 2011. The United States, rejecting any partnership with President Bashar al-Assad against ISIS, is about to launch a programme to train and equip members of the mainstream Syrian opposition in order to fight the jihadists elsewhere. Xelil said the YPG had not been consulted on the programme, adding that its requests for military supplies remained unmet.

Summary 1: This article discusses the brutal execution of a media activist by ISIS militants in Syria. The disturbing images of the execution were released by ISIS, showing the activist in an orange jumpsuit being forced to his knees before being shot. The activist was targeted for spreading information about ISIS atrocities. The same day, ISIS also released images portraying everyday life under their control as happy and carefree, showing smiling farmers using Western technology for farming.

Summary 2: ISIS executed a media activist near Aleppo, Syria, releasing images of the event. The activist, part of a group like Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, was targeted for revealing ISIS atrocities.

Article:
Almost three years after nearly leaving Liverpool Jordan Henderson has committed his long-term future to the club convinced he can win silverware at Anfield. Late in the summer of 2012, just a couple of months into the reign of Brendan Rodgers, he was lined up as makeweight in a failed bid to sign Fulham's Clint Dempsey only for the midfielder to reject the move. His determination to prove himself, and justify the £16million price tag which came with him from Sunderland the previous summer, has been rewarded not only with a new five-year £100,000-a-week contract but with the prospect of him taking over the captain's armband from Steven Gerrard when he leaves for the Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the season. Jordan Henderson is 'over the moon' after signing a new long-term contract with Liverpool . The club's vice-captain puts pen to paper on a deal which will keep him at Liverpool until 2020 . Henderson has enjoyed a strong campaign and could be handed the armband when Steven Gerrard leaves . But it is the unfulfilled potential which persuaded the 24-year-old England international to commit what should be the best years of his career to the club. 'A few years ago I had an opportunity to leave but I always knew how big this club is and I wanted to stay here for as long as possible - and nothing has changed since then,' he told liverpoolfc.com. 'I feel as though I have got a good connection with the club now and there was no doubt where my future was going to be and it was just a matter of time for my agent and the club to sort it out. 'I have been through difficult times but I would never change that because I know there will be more difficult times ahead and I'll have to use that and I'll be able to handle it a lot better. 'Hopefully we've got many years ahead of winning trophies. 'I'm the same as every other player, I want to be playing at the highest level - in the Champions League, winning trophies and being very successful. 'I had good conversations with the manager about the future of the football club and it was very bright, I was very pleased with what I was hearing. 'I want to be a big part of that and hopefully I can. 'I feel there's a lot of potential, but we need to start turning that potential into winning things. I've got a good feeling that we can do that.' Henderson arrived from Sunderland in a £16million deal in June 2011, when Kenny Dalglish was manager . The Liverpool midfielder shoots towards goal during Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Aston Villa . Rodgers hopes other players - youngsters Raheem Sterling (who has rejected a £100,000-a-week offer), Jordon Ibe and experienced defender Martin Skrtel are all currently negotiating new deals - will follow Henderson's lead. 'We are obviously delighted. It is great news for the club and Jordan that he will be spending best part of his career and development here at Liverpool and he is a big part of the plan going forward,' said the Reds boss. 'I am delighted for him and the club and we can continue his development. 'The club paid big money for him at the time because he had big potential and that potential has been developed and he will go into the next phase of that. 'The likes of Jordan and Raheem are very important players and the club, behind the scenes, is working very hard to ensure we sign these type of players. 'The model is to develop young players and when they have improved it is important you nail them to the club and make sure they are here for the best part of their careers.' Henderson has urged Liverpool team-mate Raheem Sterling to follow his lead by signing a new deal .

Summary 1: Liverpool's Jordan Henderson, once nearly swapped for Clint Dempsey, has signed a five-year contract, potentially succeeding Steven Gerrard as captain. His £16million transfer from Sunderland justified, Henderson's commitment is hoped to inspire teammates Raheem Sterling, Jordon Ibe, and Martin Skrtel, who are negotiating new deals, to also stay with the club.

Summary 2: Liverpool's Jordan Henderson, who nearly left the club three years ago, has now signed a £100,000-a-week, five-year contract, solidifying his commitment to the team. This move comes as Steven Gerrard prepares to leave for the Los Angeles Galaxy, potentially leaving the captain's armband to Henderson. Henderson's determination to justify his £16million price tag from Sunderland has been rewarded with this new contract.

Summary 3: Jordan Henderson, once nearly traded for Clint Dempsey under Brendan Rodgers' reign, has now secured his place at Liverpool with a £100,000-a-week, five-year contract. As Steven Gerrard departs for the Los Angeles Galaxy, Henderson, who justified his £16million transfer from Sunderland, is poised to take over the captaincy, demonstrating his commitment to the club.

Summary 4: This article discusses the recent developments in the career of Jordan Henderson, a professional footballer who plays for Liverpool. After nearly leaving the club three years ago, Henderson has now committed his long-term future to Liverpool by signing a new five-year contract.

American model Kendra Spears, who has been known as Princess Salwa since her marriage to the Aga Khan's son Prince Rahim, has given birth to her first child. The baby, a  boy named Prince Irfan, was born in the Swiss city of Geneva last Saturday and both mother and child are doing well. News of the birth, which was announced yesterday, has been greeted with joy by the followers of the Aga Khan, who, in a statement, spoke of his family's 'great happiness'. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: Princess Salwa Aga Khan, pictured during a photo shoot last year, has given birth to a son . Ms Spears, a Seattle-born supermodel who has starred in campaigns for Diane von Furstenburg and Chanel among others, married Prince Rahim Aga Khan in 2013 following a four month engagement. The model, 26, had been considered 'the next Cindy Crawford' by her agency Ford Models, but has put her career on the back-burner since becoming wife to the 44-year-old royal. She follows in the footsteps of a string of American royal wives, among them actress Rita Hayworth who was married to Sir Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan. Prince Rahim's younger brother Hussein, 41, also married an American, although his marriage to New Yorker Kristin White, 38, ended shortly after his brother's wedding in 2013. The Jordanian royals have also made a habit of wedding Americans, most famously Lisa Najeeb Halaby who became known as Queen Noor following her marriage. Happy couple: The royal is said to be doing well, according to her husband, Prince Rahim Aga Khan . Striking: Princess Salwa pictured left on her wedding day and right during her catwalk modelling career . Britons have also married into the Jordanian royal dynasty, most notably Antoinette Avril Gardiner, the mother of current ruler Abdullah, . Unlike the Jordanians, the Aga Khan dynasty do not have a country and instead lead the Imami Ismā'īlī Tariqah, a Shi'a Muslim sect . Like the King Abdullah of Jordan, the Aga Khan, a title bestowed upon the family by Persian (now Iran) ruler Fath-Ali Shah Qajar in 1818, claims to be a direct descendant of the Prophet Mohammed. Prince Rahim's father Prince Shah Karim Al Hussaini is the current Aga Khan and took the title aged 20 following the death of his grandfather, Sir Sultan Muhammed Shah, Aga Khan III. A British business magnate and a racehorse enthusiast, he is responsible for adding to the family fortune, which is thought to amount to more than $800m. Not all of the money was acquired through commerce, however. Part of it comes from a tithe paid by Ismaili Muslims called a 'dasond' - the equivalent of 12.5 percent of each person's gross annual income. Royal wives: Rita Hayworth also married into the Aga Khan dynasty while Queen Noor is a Jordanian royal . British connection: King Abdullah II of Jordan, pictured with Prince Charles, has a British mother .

Summary 1: American supermodel Kendra Spears, now Princess Salwa after marrying Prince Rahim Aga Khan, has given birth to Prince Irfan. Spears, likened to Cindy Crawford by Ford Models, joins Rita Hayworth, Kristin White, and Lisa Najeeb Halaby (Queen Noor) in marrying into royalty. The birth in Geneva has brought joy to the Aga Khan's followers.

Summary 2: American supermodel Kendra Spears, known as Princess Salwa after marrying Prince Rahim, son of the Aga Khan, has given birth to her first child, Prince Irfan, in Geneva. Spears, once touted as 'the next Cindy Crawford' by her agency Ford Models, has paused her career since her royal marriage. The birth has brought immense joy to the Aga Khan's followers.

Summary 3: This article discusses the joyous news of American model Kendra Spears, also known as Princess Salwa, giving birth to her first child, a boy named Prince Irfan. The birth took place in Geneva, Switzerland. The child's father is Prince Rahim, son of the Aga Khan. Both mother and child are reported to be in good health. The news has been received with great happiness by the followers of the Aga Khan.

Summary 4: Kendra Spears, an American supermodel turned Princess Salwa after marrying Prince Rahim Aga Khan, has given birth to Prince Irfan in Geneva.

Article:
A Brazilian online football store claims to have next season's Chelsea kit for sale on its website - and it can be purchased with Gareth Bale's name on the back. The website has published three Chelsea kits with the incoming 'Yokohama' sponsor across the front, albeit without the Adidas emblem, the club's kit manufacturer. But perhaps most bizarrely, or interestingly from the perspective of Chelsea supporters, the alleged new kit can be bought with 'Bale 9' on the back. A Brazilian website is claiming to have the new Chelsea kit for sale, with Gareth Bale's name on the back . Bale (centre) has struggled at Real Madrid this season and reports have linked him with a return to England . The website has the new sponsor on the front of the kits but not the Adidas emblem . Bale's struggles at Real Madrid have been well documented, with fans and the Spanish media casting him as the man to blame as Ancelotti's stuttering side have been replaced atop La Liga by Barcelona. Reports both in England and Spain have linked the Wales international with a return to the Premier League. Skeptical Chelsea supporters who wish to purchase the kit without Bale's name on the back may also want to avoid getting one with a mention of Didier Drogba. Drogba's Chelsea deal expires at the end of the season and he has not yet signed a new contract . Drogba shirts can be bought despite his uncertain future, while Chelsea's away shirt (right) is also for sale . Drogba rejoined Chelsea on a one-year contract in July 2014 and is yet to be offered a new deal at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea lead the Premier League by six points and have eight games remaining. Jose Mourinho's side play Stoke in Saturday's late kick-off.

Summary 1: A Brazilian store offers Chelsea's new 'Yokohama' kit, minus Adidas, with 'Gareth Bale' or 'Didier Drogba' on the back. Bale, blamed for Real Madrid's fall to Barcelona in La Liga, is rumored to return to the Premier League. Drogba, on a one-year contract at Stamford Bridge, has an uncertain future.

Summary 2: A Brazilian store is selling Chelsea's new kit, featuring 'Yokohama' but not Adidas, with 'Gareth Bale' on the back. Bale's performance at Real Madrid has been under scrutiny, with critics blaming him for Ancelotti's team's poor performance, leading to Barcelona replacing them at the top of La Liga. Reports suggest Bale may return to the Premier League.

Summary 3: This article discusses a Brazilian online football store that has allegedly put up for sale the next season's Chelsea kit. Interestingly, the kit can be purchased with the name 'Gareth Bale' on the back. The kit also features the new 'Yokohama' sponsor across the front, but lacks the Adidas emblem, which is the club's kit manufacturer.

Summary 4: Chelsea's new 'Yokohama' kit, sans Adidas, featuring 'Gareth Bale' or 'Didier Drogba', is available in a Brazilian store. Bale, criticized at Real Madrid, may return to the Premier League. Drogba's future at Stamford Bridge is uncertain. Chelsea, leading the Premier League by six points, has eight games left.

Niki Lauda’s red cap stood out like a beacon on the dull, grey tarmac of the biggest, most soulless paddock in all Formula One. The three-time world champion is colourful, candid and carefree. When your face is the charred remains of having nearly burned to death at the wheel of a Ferrari, why not throw caution to the wind or, in Shanghai’s case, the smog? Lauda, now chairman of Mercedes F1, aimed his first verbal grenade at his driver Nico Rosberg, who moments earlier had stood in front of him rotating his shoulders and about to play keepie-uppie to warm up for Friday's second practice session for the Chinese Grand Prix. Niki Lauda aimed a first verbal grenade at his driver Nico Rosberg ahead of the race in Shanghai . Mercedes AMG Petronas driver Rosberg is pushed back into his garage during the second practice session . Rosberg ended that session, as he did the first, behind Lewis Hamilton (below), his in-the-groove world champion team-mate who also markedly outperformed the German in the first two races, in Australia and Malaysia. Of course, not long after these words reach your breakfast tables in the shires, Rosberg may buck up and take pole, but it would be something of a surprise, not least to Lauda, if he did. ‘Yes, Nico is definitely a little bit behind Lewis,’ said the Austrian. ‘He has to sort himself out. It is not anything I can talk to him about. I don’t know why — he is not driving as well as he was. He will know what he has to do, and he must do it himself.’ Rosberg  looks on in the paddock after practice for the Chinese Formula One Grand Prix in Shanghai . Rosberg  drives during practice for the Formula One Grand Prix of China at Shanghai International Circuit . Rosberg is supremely professional. There is no lack of effort on his part. It is more that his confidence seems to have been shaken, whereas it was so strong in the early and mid parts of last season. Then Hamilton put down the hammer, changing the dynamic for both men. At least Rosberg is not the watching neutral’s only hope of a contest breaking out this season, after Ferrari shocked everyone by winning a fortnight ago. Nobody was ever more pleased to see Sebastian Vettel wagging his finger in celebration than fans whose own digits were poised over the television remotes’ off-switches, so jaundiced were they by the prospect of Mercedes’ seemingly endless hegemony. Mercedes AMG Petronas driver Rosberg chats with team members on the pit wall after the first practice . Rosberg  prepares to drive during practice for the Formula One Grand Prix at Shanghai International Circuit . Rosberg drives during practice for the Formula One Grand Prix of China at Shanghai International Circuit . As Bernie Ecclestone joked, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff could have the legend, ‘The man who killed Formula One’, engraved on his tombstone. Lauda, a long-time friend of Ecclestone, has no time for sentiment. ‘Even if Ferrari winning makes Bernie happy, I will still be upset,’ he said. ‘The priority for me and Toto and Paddy (Lowe, the technical director) is to try to win every bloody race. It is our mission. Sebastian Vettel  looks on from the team garage during practice for the China Formula One Grand Prix . Vettel  drives during practice for the Formula One Grand Prix of China at Shanghai International Circuit . ‘I don’t care about the politics or what is good for Vettel or Ferrari. It is not my responsibility to make the sport more interesting. My worry for us is that Ferrari won so early in the season. ‘That gives them a lot of momentum. For an Italian team, momentum can be very important. ‘The Italians are emotional and it works best for them when they have a blend of English, Germans and Italians. They have that now (James Allison, a British engineer is their technical director). Vettel is a four-time world champion and so is someone to look up to. They have a combination of everything.’ Most observers thought Ferrari’s win in Malaysia might be a one-off created by the absurdly hot weather. But the evidence from practice is that the Scuderia may also be contenders in the considerably cooler Shanghai climate. Even though they appear not to be as quick over one lap, they look strong, possibly stronger than Mercedes, on a long run. Ferrari's German driver Vettel is pushed back to his garage after stopping at the pit lane exit in Shanghai . Vettel drives during practice for the Formula One Grand Prix of China at Shanghai International Circuit . ‘Qualifying doesn’t really worry us,’ said Lauda. ‘But they will be close on race pace. ‘They have made a big step up with their engine from last year to this, and I believe their horsepower is the same as ours.’ That was a big, honest and uplifting claim three races into a season that was being written off as a processional yawn.

Summary 1: Mercedes F1's Niki Lauda, Toto Wolff, and Paddy Lowe aim for victory in the Chinese Grand Prix despite Nico Rosberg's shaky performance and Ferrari's momentum, led by Sebastian Vettel and technical director James Allison. Ferrari's unexpected win in Malaysia and their potential in Shanghai's cooler climate could challenge Mercedes' dominance.

Summary 2: This article discusses Niki Lauda, a three-time world champion and current chairman of Mercedes F1, who has been critical of his driver Nico Rosberg's performance. Rosberg, who was preparing for the second practice session for the Chinese Grand Prix, has been struggling to keep up with his teammate Lewis Hamilton. Lauda believes that Rosberg needs to improve his driving skills and regain his confidence to perform better in the upcoming races.

Summary 3: Niki Lauda, chairman of Mercedes F1, criticized Nico Rosberg's performance ahead of the Chinese Grand Prix, noting he was lagging behind teammate Lewis Hamilton. Despite Rosberg's professionalism and effort, his confidence seemed shaken, affecting his driving. Meanwhile, Ferrari's recent win has shifted the dynamics, posing a potential threat to Mercedes' dominance in the season.

Summary 4: Mercedes F1's Niki Lauda criticized Nico Rosberg's performance, contrasting it with Lewis Hamilton's. Lauda, along with Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe, is determined to win despite Ferrari's recent victory and Sebastian Vettel's strong performance. Rosberg's shaken confidence and Ferrari's momentum could disrupt Mercedes' dominance in the upcoming Chinese Grand Prix.

A 32-year-old English teacher who admitted having sex with a 16-year-old student posted a celebratory selfie on Instagram just hours after discovering she had avoided a prison sentence. Shelley Dufresnein from St Charles Parish, Louisiana, took a plea deal on Thursday that gets her out of serving any time behind or having to register as a sex offender. When she returned home from court she uploaded an image of her grinning to the social media site alongside the message: 'My mood today,' followed by three smiley faces. Followers started congratulating her on the outcome below the picture, prompting her to respond: 'I'm so relieved.' However she is still facing charges over a threesome she had with the same student at Destrehan High School and another teacher. 'My mood today': Shelley Dufresnein from St Charles Parish, Louisiana, posted this selfie on Instagram after discovering she had avoided jail - despite admitting she had sex with a 16-year-old student . Reaction: Followers started congratulating her on the outcome below the picture, prompting her to respond: 'I'm so relieved'. However she still faces charges she had a threesome with the student and another teacher . 'Free' woman: The 32-year-old, confessed in court Thursday to having sex with a 16-year-old English student in exchange for a plea deal that gets her out of prison time. The married mother-of-three pictured above leaving the St Charles Parish Courthouse on Thursday . Double the trouble: Dufresne (right) and fellow teacher Rachel Respess, 24 (left), were arrested in September when a student at Destrehan High School started bragging that he was sleeping with both of them . How they met: The unidentified 16-year-old victim was a student in Dufresne's English class last year. Respess taught the same student English the year prior . She was arrested in September after the teen in question started bragging to friends that he had slept with two teachers. An investigation later revealed that the unidentified teen had sex with both his current English teacher at the time, Dufresne, and his English teacher from the prior year, 24-year-old Rachel Respess - including an alleged a threesome with both at Respess's house. Though she originally pleaded not guilty in November, married mother-of-three Dufresne changed course and confessed to the sordid act at a status conference in court on Thursday. Comfortable: As part of her plea deal, Dufresne will not have to serve any jail time. Instead she will undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment program, surrender her teacher's license and stay away from the victim and his family . In exchange for pleading guilty to a count of obscenity, the original charge of carnal knowledge of a juvenile will be held for the three years Dufresne is under probation for obscenity. Dufresne must also undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment, surrender her teacher's license, and stay away from the now 17-year-old victim and his family. If she complies with all of those terms, the carnal knowledge charge will be dropped after three years and she will not have to register as a sex offender. The carnal knowledge charge carries a maximum of ten years in prison and a fine for $5,000. Judge Anne Simon signed off on the plea deal, after three other judges - including Dufresne's father Judge Emile St Pierre - removed themselves from the case. District Attorney Joel Chaisson II heralded the deal as a success. 'I want to thank my special prosecutor, Julie Cullen, for her efforts to reach a fair resolution of the case and to secure a felony guilty plea, thereby sparing the juvenile victim in this matter from having to testify at a public trial,' the DA said in a statement. The parents of the victim were in court on Thursday, and according to media who attended the meeting, they were not happy with the settlement. However, Dufresne's legal battle is likely not over yet. When her relationship with the teen was exposed last fall, it was revealed that she had sex with the teen at a residence in Montz (Dufresne and her family live in Montz) and one in Kenner between August 22 and September 27. Dufresne still faces the possibility of jail time for allegedly having a threesome with the same student and Respess at Respess' residence in another Louisiana parish (pictured above). Neither woman has been formally arraigned on those charges yet . Above, Dufresne's home in Montz, Louisiana. The charges she settled Thursday had to do with sex acts she and the 16-year-old committed at a residence in that town . Both towns fall under different parishes, and Jefferson Parish has yet to formally arraign Dufresne on charges of carnal knowledge with a juvenile, indecent behavior with a juvenile and contributing to the delinquency of a child. It was at Respess' home in Kenner that the teachers allegedly had a three-way with the student after a high school football game in September, and that is the incident they await arraignment on. Since her arrest on September 30, Dufresne has remained free on bond. While she has been under house arrest during this time, the rules of the sequester have been loosened so that she can attend therapy sessions, Jazzercize classes and help drive her 3, 5, and 7-year-old children to school and extracurricular activities. However, she had to spend 8pm to 7am inside her home during the weekdays. Both Dufresne and Respess were suspended from their jobs without pay following their arrests last fall.

Article:
The morning after the row the night before, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg barely exchanged a word in the first-class cabin of their Emirates flight to Dubai, en route to the next race in Bahrain. If the two Mercedes drivers are not quite on non-speaking terms, they are communicating only when they have to. While they kept quiet among themselves, both had a further say in public about the dispute that broke out after the Chinese Grand Prix. Hamilton was particularly strident saying that the difference is that he is a ‘racer’ and Rosberg is not. Lewis Hamilton (right) and Nico Rosberg have both had their say on Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix . Winner Hamilton (centre) waves to the crowd as Rosberg (left) and Sebastian Vettel shake hands . Briefly, the bones of the argument are these. Rosberg, who was beaten into second place by Hamilton, said his team-mate had been ‘selfish’ by slowing down while leading the race. It caused him (Rosberg) to be bunched up closer to the attacking Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel, whom he feared could overhaul him. Vettel did not manage to do so and finished third. The verbal spat played out at the press conference as the two protagonists sat side by side. Rosberg fumed. Hamilton smiled, seemingly happy to have riled his title rival. But it can now be revealed what happened after they finished their subsequent round of interviews in the Shanghai paddock on Sunday night. Both went through their usual engineering debriefs before being brought in one by one to meet senior Mercedes management including Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe, team principal and technical director respectively. Hamilton went in first and was in conversation with his bosses for half an hour. Rosberg for 20 minutes, now in a room illuminated by lights as darkness crept in outside. Then, more than two hours after the race had finished, Wolff was happy the team had got their story straight enough to speak to journalists. It was now 90 minutes after his scheduled press conference. Rosberg (left) was clearly angry with Hamilton in Sunday's press conference and hit out at his team-mate . The British driver (right) denied he had done anything wrong following Rosberg's accusations . Hamilton (right) backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team-mate's race . He declared the talks ‘positive’ and cleared both his drivers of wrongdoing. Hamilton then spoke to the press under an embargo that mean his words have not appeared until now. ‘Nico didn’t try,’ he said with passion, often repeating his words for emphasis. ‘Nico didn’t try. ‘They said maybe he was just comfortable in second place and I said, “Well that’s the difference between us. I want to win always.” ‘And I would have done everything to get past today. Or at least pushed for three laps. He wasn’t quick enough. ‘This is motor racing, man. Racing. Don’t take away the fun of the racing. It’s racing. I wouldn’t have sat back two seconds to make it to the end of the stint. ‘I don’t even know what Nico’s point is. Where we are is that I just won the race today. I did the best job I could possibly have done and the team got a one-two.’ Hamilton’s explanation for slowing down is that he was running his own race and conserving his tyres as best suited him. No neutral I have spoken to within Formula One disputes the world champion’s rationale. Hamilton (centre) celebrates his win with the Mercedes team, but Rosberg (right) appears less pleased . Hamilton crosses the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . ‘Ultimately this is Formula One,’ added Hamilton. ‘I want the guy to be up my a*** if he’s got the pace to be up my a***, and putting pressure on me. And if I can’t defend it, I lose, like in Bahrain last year. I wasn’t quick enough and I did everything I could to stay ahead. And that was the greatest race ever.’ The greatest race of this young century, certainly. Both drivers are now spending a few days in Dubai before travelling to Bahrain for this year’s race on Sunday. Before leaving, and without knowing what Hamilton had said, Rosberg offered his considered version of events through his customary post-race video, on which he answered fans’ questions. One asked if he was ‘crying’ – by which the questioner meant moaning or being a poor loser. Rosberg said: ‘You say that I was crying. OK, I respect your opinion, and I’ll keep it in mind and I’ll try to show respect when it’s due going forward.’ Hamilton in front of team-mate Rosberg during Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai . Rosberg (right) speaks with Mercedes executive director Toto Wolff in Shanghai during the weekend . But why did he not push to pass Hamilton? ‘It might not be so easy to understand from the outside,’ said the German. ‘But the reason is, I did try to attack Lewis in the first stint, and it just didn’t work. All I did was destroy my tyres. ‘So in the second stint there was no point to do that again. I would have completely destroyed my tyres and Vettel could have had a really good shot at overtaking me. My only chance of winning the race anyway, or to fight Lewis, or try to overtake him, would have come at the end of the race, so that’s what I was building up to. ‘The worst part of the weekend was losing out to Lewis in qualifying. That compromised me most. And it was by just four-hundredths. That’s all down to me to be those five-hundredths quicker next time.’

Summary 1: This article discusses a dispute between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, two Mercedes drivers, following the Chinese Grand Prix. The disagreement arose from Rosberg's accusation that Hamilton had selfishly slowed down during the race, causing Rosberg to be closely followed by another competitor. Hamilton defended his actions, stating that he was merely racing and conserving his tyres. The two drivers barely spoke to each other during their flight to Dubai for the next race.

Summary 2: Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg had a disagreement after the Chinese Grand Prix. Rosberg accused Hamilton of selfishly slowing down, causing him to be closely pursued by Sebastian Vettel. Hamilton defended his actions, stating he was conserving his tyres. Post-race, both drivers met separately with Mercedes management, including Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe, before flying to Dubai for the next race.

Summary 3: Post-Chinese Grand Prix, Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg clashed over Hamilton's race strategy. Rosberg accused Hamilton of slowing down, risking his second place to Sebastian Vettel. Hamilton defended his tyre conservation strategy. Both met with Mercedes management, including Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe, before their silent Emirates flight to Bahrain. The dispute continued at a press conference.

Summary 4: After the Chinese Grand Prix, Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg disputed Hamilton's race strategy. Rosberg claimed Hamilton's slowdown risked his second place to Sebastian Vettel. Hamilton defended his tyre conservation strategy, leading to his win. Post-race, they met with Mercedes management, then flew to Bahrain. Rosberg addressed the issue in a video, blaming his qualifying round performance.

Article:
College basketball player Lauren Hill lost her battle with cancer on Friday morning, aged just 19. The Indiana native, who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday, had defied doctors' expectations after they told her that she would not live past December. Instead, she played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer, Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma. But as her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where she passed away on Friday morning. Scroll down for video . Loss: Lauren Hill, who is pictured playing for Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati in November, died in hospital on Friday - aged just 19 - after a brave battle with a rare form of brain cancer . Just a year and a half ago, Hill was just another high school student getting ready for college after she decided to play basketball at Mount St. Joseph. A few weeks later, she started experiencing dizziness while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found the tumor and she was told that she had less than two years left. But in September, doctors told her she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout high school basketball player, Hill's hopes of playing college ball were put in jeopardy. But the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition, and on November 2, she realized her dream of playing for the school. She scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. 'It's a dream come true,' she said. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013 and right in December 2014 after her treatment for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, a rare childhood brain cancer, changed her appearance . Brave: Hill, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December . Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter and St Patrick's Day from hospital in Cincinnati . At the game, she said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game, USA Today reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Hill played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, her family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday. Fighter: The NCAA moved the school's first game forward last November (pictured) so that Lauren could achieve her dream of playing for collegiate basketball. She scored the first and last baskets . Heroic: Hill, left, smiles at Pat Summitt after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game in November last year. She went on to play four games for the school . 'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' her coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.' No information about a memorial has yet been released but Lawrenceburg Schools superintendent Karl Galey said on Twitter that schools will be prepared to assist staff and students with counseling.

Summary 1: Lauren Hill, a Mount St. Joseph University basketball player, battled Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, raising $1.5 million for research through The Cure Starts Now foundation. Despite her prognosis, the NCAA allowed her to play against Hiram College. As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach and received the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award. She was also featured on a Wheaties box before her death.

(CNN)Canadian actor Jonathan Crombie, who co-starred in the "Anne of Green Gables" TV movies, died this week at age 48. Crombie died Wednesday from complications of a brain hemorrhage, "Anne of Green Gables" producer Kevin Sullivan said. "It's a real tragedy to see someone at age 48 go like that," he said. "I will remember him as someone who worked extremely hard to make the roles he played onscreen come to life." Based on Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery's children's books, "Anne of Green Gables" debuted in Canada on CBC TV in 1984 and became a cultural touchstone. The plot focused on the adventures of fiery orphan Anne Shirley, played by Megan Follows, who is sent to live on a farm in Prince Edward Island. Crombie played Gilbert Blythe, who evolves over time from Anne's pigtail-tugging tormentor to friend to husband. Follows and Crombie reprised the roles in the sequels "Anne of Avonlea" (1987) and "Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story" (2000). The movies were carried in the United States by the Disney Channel and PBS, drawing a cult following beyond Canada and extending to Japan, which made its own animated series based on the books. Crombie, son of former Toronto Mayor David Crombie, was cast in the role at 17, beating out other aspiring Canadian actors of the era, including Jason Priestly, Sullivan said. Despite his lack of acting experience, Crombie's boy-next-door looks and cool demeanor made him the perfect actor to star opposite Follows, Sullivan said. "It was an amazing chemistry between him and Megan Follows," Sullivan said. "There was a lot of affection, but they kind of grounded each other." The movies spawned various spinoffs, including "Road to Avonlea," starring child actor Sarah Polley, and turned Anne's fictional home on Prince Edward Island into a popular tourist destination. The role made Crombie a heartthrob of his time, a sentiment expressed by many fans in the wake of his death. As one person said on Twitter, "I don't know any female Canadian from my generation that *didn't* have at least a little bit of a crush on Jonathan Crombie as Gilbert." Crombie went on to play roles in other American and Canadian TV shows, including "21 Jump Street" and "The Good Wife," but even his Facebook page acknowledges he is best known for his portrayal of Gilbert Blythe. Crombie's sister told CBC News that her brother happily answered to the name Gil when greeted by fans in public. "I think he was really proud of being Gilbert Blythe," she said. "He really enjoyed that series and was happy, very proud of it -- we all were." People we've lost in 2015 .

Known locally as Millionaires’ Row, the Western Esplanade cul-de-sac of 11 white Art Deco houses with private beaches at the end of Hove promenade is a real-life version of the TV comedy Stella Street. The sitcom featured impressionists playing celebrities such as Michael Caine and Keith Richards living as neighbours. But put the rubbish out here in Hove and you could be saying good morning to Oscar and Grammy award-winning singer Adele, Little Britain comedian and novelist David Walliams, DJ Norman Cook and his Strictly Come Dancing wife Zoe Ball, and former EastEnders and Heartbeat star Nick Berry. Scroll down for video . One of the white Art Deco houses on the Western Esplanade cul-de-sac has gone on sale for £4million . In previous years you might have been greeted by Paul McCartney, his then wife Heather Mills, or even by partying guests such as Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner. The homes were built between 1909 and 1910 by developer Michael Paget Baxter when overcrowding on British beaches in their heyday meant that a home with a private beach was the last word in luxury. And that still seems to be true. With celebrities occupying six of the properties – Cook and his wife have three, two for them and one for relatives – that leaves just five other houses. And in a rare event, one of those has just come on the market, for a guide price of £4 million. Approached from the back, the cul-de-sac does not look anything special, tucked away behind the warehouses of the working port of Shoreham. But sitting in the lounge of Malcolm VandenBurg’s splendid home on a sunny day, with the sea seemingly lapping at the floor-to-ceiling windows, you could be in Miami or Malibu. The whole of the back of the house is glass on the ground and first floors. Decking stretches on to the beach, and there is a hot tub. Stunning: The view of the sea from the property's modern living room. The whole of the back of the house is glass on the ground and first floors . Meet the locals: Singer Adele has a house in the exclusive cul-de-sac alongside comedian David Walliams . ‘Bringing the sea into the house was the aim,’ says Malcolm, a retired Harley Street doctor. ‘Bizarrely, the former owners didn’t make use of the sea views. So I opened up the back and put the terrace in and the balcony upstairs. ‘Now, when you walk in the front door you can see the sea from everywhere. It took a year but it was well worth it. It still takes my breath away every time I come home. ‘And sitting outside on the terrace with a fish barbecue with the sound system on full is just perfect. I’ve had a lot of impromptu parties.’ Malcolm, in his 60s and the father of four grown-up children, bought the four-bedroom house in 2010 after moving from London, where he had seen Adele perform at the Roundhouse in what he describes as his favourite gig of all time. So when the singer moved in to the cul-de-sac, he was ‘starstruck’. ‘She has this lovely little dog and, in the summer, when all the doors are open, the dog wanders into my house and Adele comes round to find it. She’s completely normal and everyone here is very pleasant and we all get on well,’ says Malcolm. Price £4 million . Location Hove, East Sussex . Bedrooms 4 . Unique features Beach for a back garden; cinema room; huge dressing room; high-tech controls for hi-fi, curtains, lighting; celebrities on every side . He also welcomed Walliams and his wife, model Lara Stone, by taking round a bunch of flowers. Unhappily they have now split up. Cook popped round one day when he heard that Malcolm was selling his vinyl record collection. ‘I thought he might buy the lot, but he didn’t want any of them,’ he laughs. The ground floor of Malcolm’s house has oak flooring throughout and there is a large entrance hall with a floating staircase, a media/cinema room, kitchen, snug and a 45ft lounge. Upstairs, the master suite and bathroom overlook the sea and a huge dressing room is the size of some of the designer clothes shops in the nearby North Laine of Brighton. Malcolm’s home has the latest high-tech automated systems, including a Lutron lighting control system, video door entry, digital music and video systems, integrated speakers, motorised curtains – in fact, everything a celebrity would be looking for. So who does he think will buy the house? Has Cook already been round with an offer to add to his portfolio? ‘No he hasn’t,’ says Malcolm. ‘I think he’s happy with what he has at the moment. But whoever does buy will never get tired of the wonderful, ever-changing views. Like me, they’ll fall in love with it straight away.’ Selling agent Jason Brand says: ‘This is the best beach residence to come on the market for years and one of the very few homes in Brighton, indeed the UK, to have direct private beach access.’

Summary 1: In the celebrity-studded Western Esplanade cul-de-sac, Malcolm VandenBurg's £4 million Art Deco house, neighbored by stars like Adele, David Walliams, and Norman Cook, offers direct sea views and private beach access.

Politicians are criss-crossing the country wooing voters ahead of the election in 27 days’ time. But in more than half of seats the result is already known, according to new analysis of safe seats. More than 25million live in constituencies where the result can already be predicted, because one party is so far ahead. There are 650 seats up for grabs on May 7, with Labour and the Tories needing more than half to secure a majority. However, the Electoral Reform Society claims the result in 364 seats can be called now, based on current polls and how ‘safe’ they were in 2010. Scroll down for video . Some 70 per cent of seats in the East of England are considered safe, compared to 10 per cent in Scotland, where the SNP is expected to make sweeping gains . Of 303 Tory seats, 186 are considered safe while 151 of Labour’s 257 constituencies are not expected to change hands. The Lib Dems are defending 56 seats, of which only seven are considered safe, after a dramatic collapse in their poll ratings since joining the coalition with the Tories. Some parts of the country are more likely to play a role in deciding the outcome of the election than others. For example, 70 per cent of seats in the East of England are considered safe, compared to 10 per cent in Scotland, where the SNP is expected to make sweeping gains. The ERS has produced a new online tool for voters to see if they live in an area where the election result will be decided. It is campaigning for a change to the voting system, arguing that First Past The Post, where the winning candidate just needs to get the most votes, fails to take account of the changing face of British politics. Of 303 Tory seats, 186 are considered safe while 151 of Labour’s 257 constituencies are not expected to change hands.The Lib Dems are defending 56 seats, of which only seven are considered safe, after a dramatic collapse in their poll ratings since joining the coalition with the Tories . Based on the 2010 election result, David Cameron needs to win another 23 more seats to secure a majority in the Commons, while Ed Miliband needs at least  70. Nick Clegg is defending 56 seats, but is braced for heavy losses . The Tories need to win only 23 more seats to obtain a majority in the Commons, while Labour need 70. The polls suggests it could take three or more parties to form a majority, including the SNP, Lib Dems, DUP, Greens and Ukip. Katie Ghose, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: ‘The fact that we can firmly predict the outcome of over half of the seats being contested this May is a sorry indictment of our outdated voting system. “The average constituency hasn’t changed hands since the 1960s, and some have been under the same party’s control since the reign of Queen Victoria. This is a huge disincentive for people to get out there and vote, and for other parties to challenge incumbents. We have a system which actively discourages voters and parties from taking part. “We urgently need a fairer electoral system to give voice to the many millions of people in safe seats who are not being heard. “Predicting the winners in a majority of seats shouldn’t be possible in a truly dynamic and modern democracy. But sadly that’s exactly what we’ve been able to do. The UK needs a fair voting system to bring our politics into the 21st century and give us a Parliament that actually reflects people’s wishes.” As part of the 2010 coalition agreement, the Lib Dems and Tories held a referendum on changing the voting system to the Alternative Vote, which allows voters to give their first and second choice of candidate. The winner is the first candidate to get over 50 per cent of the vote. However, in the referendum in 2011 it was roundly defeated when 67.9 per cent voted against it.

Summary 1: Ahead of the May 7 election, politicians from Labour and the Tories are campaigning nationwide. The Electoral Reform Society predicts the outcome of 364 out of 650 seats, due to the 'safe seats' phenomenon where one party has a significant lead. The society argues that the current voting system fails to capture the evolving political dynamics and advocates for a reform.

Summary 2: Labour and the Tories, led by Ed Miliband and David Cameron respectively, are campaigning for the May 7 election. The Electoral Reform Society forecasts 364 'safe seats' out of 650. Cameron needs 23 more seats for a majority. The society criticizes the current voting system's inability to reflect changing politics and calls for reform.

Summary 3: The article discusses the upcoming election, where politicians are campaigning across the country. According to the Electoral Reform Society, the results of 364 seats are already predictable due to the concept of 'safe seats'. These are constituencies where one party is significantly ahead, making the outcome almost certain. The society is advocating for a change in the voting system, arguing that the current system does not reflect the changing political landscape.

Summary 4: For the May 7 election, Labour's Ed Miliband and the Tories' David Cameron need 70 and 23 more seats respectively. The Electoral Reform Society predicts 364 'safe seats', including those from SNP, Lib Dems, and DUP. The society argues the current voting system fails to mirror evolving politics and demands reform.

These adorable abandoned badger cubs have been nursed back to health by a kind-hearted animal lover on a diet of custard creams. The orphaned youngsters - one of which escaped death after being carried away in a Jack Russell's mouth - are doing better than ever after they were taken in by retired farmer Pauline Kidner. Nursed originally on milk form bottles custard creams were introduced into their diet slowly to see whether the cubs were ready for food. Scroll down for video . The orphaned youngsters - one of which escaped death after being carried by a dog - are doing better . Nursed originally on milk, custard creams were introduced to see whether the cubs were ready for food . 'They were very very tiny, we start them off giving them milk with a teat on syringe,' Pauline said . The first of the badger cubs, named Little Star, was half the weight of an apple when it arrived at the Secret World centre, but Pauline, who runs charity Secret World, says they're growing at an astonishing rate. The 65-year-old, from Somerset, said: 'When they came in eight weeks ago they were 80g, now they're 1.1kg, you can almost see them growing.' 'They were very very tiny, we start them off giving them milk with a teat on syringe, we can't risk any getting in their lungs, but they're now on normal bottles. 'Little Star came from Derbyshire, she was brought into someone's kitchen by their Jack Russell dog, it was very lucky he didn't hurt her, she'd been born two days earlier; her umbilical was still attached . 'The dog brought another one in, but sadly that one had been shaken, so unfortunately it died within 24 hours . Pauline explained to have two badger cubs picked up by dogs in a short space of time is unusual. 'One cub a year is brought in when dogs get down in the set,' she said. The dog brought another one in, but sadly that one had been shaken, so it died within 24 hours . The first of the badger cubs, named Little Star, was half the weight of an apple when it arrived at centre . Jack Russels have an instinct for digging and going down holes and are traditionally used in badger baiting. However, there is no reason to suspect the illegal blood-sport was to blame for the death of this cub. 'Then we had another called Vogue come up from Cornwall, we called her that because was picked up in the village Vogue near Redruth,' Pauline said. 'Then lastly the third came in three weeks ago, that one's from near Cheddar in Somerset, we called him Scrumpy, because of the cider context . When they came in eight weeks ago they were 80g - carers have watched them grow to 1.1kg . They're 12 to 16 weeks once they wean, then they might be moved on to solids by the carers . 'We've been keeping Scrumpy separate as he's older than the two girls. Once they start to mouth things, they start playing with each other, pulling ears, Scrumpy can get a bit rough though.' 'They're still on bottles now, we've started putting in custard creams to see if they're interested, then we might move them on to solids. 'They're in the cubby hole in my kitchen now.' The aim is to release the animals back into the wild once they're strong enough. They're all vaccinated against Bovine TB, before they reduce human contact. Pauline said: 'We'll add another two to the group, we'll keep them together before release in autumn. 'When they're 12 to 16 weeks once they wean, they go down to the Millie Block, which is a separate building. 'After that they turn nocturnal, we feed them at night, then it's on to glassed enclosures when we just throw the food over to them and get them to revert to wild.' 'Sadly if we can't release them, we do have to put them to sleep, which is why we reduce human contact like that.' After they move to their nocturnal sleep rhythm they will be put in glass enclosures and then released .

Summary 1: Retired farmer Pauline Kidner, based in Somerset, has been caring for orphaned badger cubs at the Secret World centre. One cub, Little Star, was brought in by a Jack Russell dog, weighing as little as half an apple. Now, the cubs are thriving on a diet of milk and custard creams, showing significant growth, and have been vaccinated against Bovine TB.

Summary 2: In Somerset, Pauline Kidner rehabilitates orphaned badger cubs at the Secret World centre. Little Star, found by a Jack Russell, Vogue from Cornwall, and Scrumpy from Cheddar, are thriving on a diet of milk and custard creams, showing significant growth. Vaccinated against Bovine TB, the cubs are planned for release in the wild in autumn.

Summary 3: This article discusses the heartwarming story of a retired farmer named Pauline Kidner who has been nursing abandoned badger cubs back to health at the Secret World centre.

It is billed as the most important meal of the day and many people grade a restaurant on the quality of their bacon and eggs on offer. But after fierce competition and testing, experts have ruled the the best breakfast is available from your local Morrisons. The supermarket beat major hotel, restaurant and pub chains to achieve the title of Britain's Best Breakfast. Morrisons has been named the best place to get breakfast in the UK - beating restaurants, pubs and hotels to win the title - with its Big Breakfast (pictured) one of the most popular items on its extensive morning menu . It was picked out by judges of the Menu Innovation and Development Awards (MIDAS) for its value for money, food quality and customer satisfaction. Richard Jones, Morrisons Head Chef, said: 'The Great British breakfast is a national institution, so to be voted the nation's best is an honour. 'The secret of our success is offering shoppers a good selection of fresh breakfast items to please all tastes - granola and porridge have become very popular in recent times, and of course there's nothing like the breakfast of champions, the Full English.' The supermarket chain offers a variety of breakfasts from porridge with red berries to its infamous Big Breakfast for £4.50. Morrisons was named best in the breakfast category, beating Wetherspoons and Bella Italia which were shortlisted for the awards. Last year the award went to Intercontinental Hotels which charges £28 for its cooked breakfast at its 5-star London Park Lane hotel. And the year before Macdonald Hotels won the accolade. A full English at its 4-star Macdonald Manchester Hotel and Spa costs £19.50 . Mystery shoppers tried breakfasts at restaurants, pubs and hotels nationwide to name Morrisons the winner . The MIDAS awards were launched to recognise the efforts of food development managers in major restaurant and food service chains, and previous winners include the Marriott and InterContinental hotel groups. As part of the judging process organisers send a team of 'mystery shoppers' to try the breakfast menu at all competing venues - from croissants and bacon rolls to the Full English. They then score each menu in terms of value for money, food quality and customer expectation levels. Morrisons' 400 in-store cafes, which serve breakfast until 4pm. Nationwide they sell 100,000 Big Breakfasts a week, and also stock vegetarian options. Morrison's nationwide sell around 10,000 of their signature 'Big Breakfast' a week. This has: . 3 x rashers of British Market St. Bacon . 1 x British Market St. Sausage . 1 x Egg (choice of Fried, Scrambled or Poached) 2 x Hash Browns . Heinz Baked Beanz . Mushrooms . Fried Tomato . Fried Bread . Served with red or brown sauce . Simon Peat, of award organisers Inside Foodservice, said: 'Our judges were dispatched to three Morrisons across the country, to try the full range of items on the menu, and they scored top marks each time. Morrisons is the best place for breakfast. 'As the saying goes, breakfast is the most important meal of the day - and there's lot of prestige within the industry to be named as the home of the best breakfast in the UK.' British breakfast staples have enjoyed a boost in popularity recently - with sales of British back bacon and eggs increasing. In 2013 British bacon producers exported over £33million worth of the meat to nearly 70 countries, with another £1.3million worth of black pudding sold to foreign countries including Spain, Ireland and Norway. Eggs were exported to 57 countries.

Summary 1: Morrisons supermarket, lauded by MIDAS for Britain's Best Breakfast, outshone chains like Wetherspoons, Bella Italia, Intercontinental Hotels, and Macdonald Hotels. The £4.50 Big Breakfast, praised by Head Chef Richard Jones, was a key factor. The award, based on value, quality, and satisfaction, was determined by 'mystery shoppers' who sampled and scored breakfast menus nationwide.

Summary 2: Morrisons, awarded Britain's Best Breakfast by MIDAS, outperformed Wetherspoons, Bella Italia, Intercontinental and Macdonald Hotels. The £4.50 Big Breakfast, served in 400 in-store cafes and selling 100,000 a week, was praised by Head Chef Richard Jones. The award, based on 'mystery shoppers' evaluations of value, quality, and satisfaction, also noted vegetarian options.

Summary 3: This article discusses how Morrisons, a supermarket chain, has been awarded the title of Britain's Best Breakfast. The award was given by the Menu Innovation and Development Awards (MIDAS), who judged the breakfast offerings based on value for money, food quality, and customer satisfaction.

Hundreds of payday lenders will be wiped out by tougher rules designed to protect customers, experts have predicted. It comes as Wonga, the UK’s biggest payday loans firm, today revealed it racked up a £37.3million loss last year following a significant reduction in UK consumer lending while it attempts to clean up its tarnished image. Revenues declined to £217.2million in the period, down by almost £100million. Wonga's executive chairman Andy Haste said: 'We know it will take time to repair our reputation and gain an accepted place in the financial services industry, but we're determined to deliver on our plans and serve our customers in the right way.' Hundreds of payday lenders, such as Wonga, will be wiped out by tougher rules designed to protect customers, experts have predicted . The City watchdog has forecast that just three or four payday lenders out of 400 will be left standing following the introduction of the rules in January. They include a daily interest cap of 0.8 per cent and stricter affordability checks to ensure customers can repay loans. The true picture should become clearer later this year, as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) attempts to weed out dodgy firms. Payday lenders have all had to apply for a license to trade and will learn in the coming months whether they have been successful. Robin Savage, an analyst from investment bank Canaccord Genuity described some of the tactics used by payday lenders – such as extending loan terms and adding interest to customers who cannot afford to repay - as ‘evil’. He said: ‘If firms can’t do proper checks and find customers that can repay them then they do not deserve to survive.’ Wonga, has become a lightning rod for public fury over payday lenders. Last year it took a £35million hit from writing off debts worth £220million owed by more than 300,000 customers. It was also ordered to pay £2.6million in compensation after sending fake legal letters between 2008 and 2010 to 45,000 customers who had fallen behind on their repayments. The City watchdog has forecast that just three or four payday lenders out of 400 will be left standing following the introduction of the rules in January (file picture) A charge of almost £20million will be incurred by the firm to cover compensation as well as legal and administrative costs. Wonga has been accused of trying to lure youngsters to take out payday loans with its controversial puppet adverts. Its new chairman Andy Haste – brought in to clean up the business – has ditched the adverts and admitted that it will be smaller and less profitable under the new regime. The cap on the cost of loans has reduced Wonga’s annual interest rate from 5,853per cent to 1,509 per cent since the changes were enforced in January. This will not be reflected in the figures released today, which cover last year. But the losses will include redundancy pay-outs, as Wonga is halving its UK workforce, with the loss of 325 jobs. Today’s figures showed a slump in customers, after Wonga stricter affordability checks in October – ahead of changes enforced by the FCA in January.

Summary 1: Wonga, facing a £37.3million loss, £217.2million revenue, and stricter rules like a 0.8 per cent interest cap from the FCA, wrote off £35million in debts and paid £2.6million in compensation for fake legal letters. The firm, criticized by analyst Robin Savage, is also cutting 325 jobs amidst its financial and reputational struggles.

Summary 2: Wonga, the UK's leading payday loans firm, suffered a £37.3million loss and a revenue drop to £217.2million last year. The firm is striving to repair its image amidst the introduction of tougher rules in the industry, including a daily interest cap of 0.8 per cent and stricter affordability checks, which are expected to wipe out hundreds of payday lenders.

Summary 3: This article discusses the financial struggles of Wonga, the UK's largest payday loans firm, which reported a loss of £37.3million last year. The company's revenues also fell to £217.2million, a decrease of nearly £100million. The firm is currently trying to improve its tarnished image and regain its place in the financial services industry.

Summary 4: Wonga, the UK's top payday loan firm, reported a £37.3million loss and £217.2million revenue amidst stricter industry rules, including a 0.8 per cent interest cap. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is overseeing these changes, requiring lenders to apply for a trade license. Analyst Robin Savage criticized lenders' tactics, calling them 'evil'.

Manchester City have not won a Premier League game having been behind at half-time in almost 20 years. The shocking stat is revealed as City's title hopes lay in tatters following Monday night's 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace which Manuel Pellegrini's side trailed at the interval. The last time City managed to win having been in a losing position at half-time was on April 17, 1995 when they beat Blackburn Rovers 3-2 having been 2-1 down at the break. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany and Joe Hart trudge off the field after losing to Crystal Palace . Man City have not managed to win a Premier League fixture having trailed at half-time in almost 20 years . Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini looks to the floor at Selhurst Park as his side's title dreams lay in tatters . While City have spent five seasons out of the top-flight since the 1994-95 campaign - which Rovers went on to win - the stat still makes for incredible reading as the blue side of Manchester look to retain their Premier League crown and claim their third title in four seasons. City's goalscorers that day were defender Keith Curle, now manager of League 2 strugglers Carlisle, from the penalty spot,  former Brentford boss Uwe Rosler and Paul Walsh. City went on to finish the Premier League season in 17th, two places above the drop zone. Blackburn: Flowers, Kenna, Berg, Pearce, Hendry, Le Saux, Sherwood, Atkins (Batty, 78), Ripley, Sutton, Shearer. Scorers: Shearer, 7, Hendry, 39. Booked: Sutton, Atkins. Manchester City: Coton, Edghill, Foster, Curle, Kernaghan, Summerbee, Flitcroft, Simpson, Rosler, Walsh (Beagrie, 78), Quinn. Scorers: Curle (pen), 32, Rosler, 57, Walsh 71. Booked: Kernaghan, Simpson. Paul Walsh scores  in April 1995 - the last time Man City won having trailed at half-time in the Premier League . Uwe Rosler (left) celebrates equalising against Blackburn as Man City staged a comeback at Ewood Park . Alan Shearer celebrates for the eventual Premier League winners after scoring the opener on seven minutes . While City have not won having trailed at the interval in almost two decades, all of City's top six rivals have managed to overturn half-time deficits in the last five years. Spurs came from behind to beat Hull in November 2014, Manchester United and Chelsea claimed victory after trailing at half-time last season. Liverpool beat Aston Villa after losing 1-0 at the interval against Aston Villa in March 2013 while Arsenal came from 2-1 down to beat Chelsea 5-3 in October 2011. To make matters worse, it seems Manuel Pellegrini's men are in need of some new blood. City had the second oldest starting XI in the Premier League this weekend with an average age of 29 years and 345 days; only West Brom fielded an older side, during their 4-1 home defeat to QPR. Sergio Aguero, Vincent Kompany and goalkeeper Joe Hart were the only starters against Palace aged 28 or under. Arsenal – 29/10/11 – 2-1 down at Chelsea at HT, won 5-3 . Chelsea – 11/5/14 – 1-0 down at Cardiff at HT, won 2-1 . Liverpool – 31/3/13 – 1-0 down at Aston Villa at HT, won 2-1 . Manchester United – 5/10/13 – 1-0 down at Sunderland at HT, won 2-1 . Tottenham  – 23/11/14 – 1-0 down at Hull at HT, won 2-1 . Here are more shocking stats which shame Man City... Swansea have earned two more Premier League points than Manchester City since selling Wilfried Bony .

Summary 1: Manchester City's Premier League woes, epitomized by a 20-year drought of half-time comebacks, were highlighted by a recent defeat to Crystal Palace. Their last such triumph was in 1995 against Blackburn Rovers, with goals from Keith Curle and Uwe Rosler. Figures like manager Manuel Pellegrini, captain Vincent Kompany, and Joe Hart are central to this narrative.

Summary 2: Manchester City's Premier League struggle, marked by a 20-year inability to win when trailing at half-time, was underscored by a 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace. The last such victory was in 1995 against Blackburn Rovers. Manager Manuel Pellegrini, captain Vincent Kompany, and goalkeeper Joe Hart are key figures in this ongoing challenge.

Summary 3: This article discusses the surprising fact that Manchester City, a prominent team in the Premier League, has not won a game in which they were behind at half-time in almost 20 years. This was highlighted following their recent 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace. The last time they achieved such a comeback was in 1995 against Blackburn Rovers.

Summary 4: Manchester City's Premier League struggles, marked by a 20-year half-time comeback drought, were accentuated by a loss to Crystal Palace. Their last such win was in 1995 against Blackburn Rovers, with goals from Keith Curle and Uwe Rosler. In contrast, top six rivals like Spurs and Manchester United have overturned half-time deficits in recent years.

(CNN)Sophisticated, glamorous and spacious -- when the super-rich go house-hunting they are searching for something special. Real estate in London's swankier suburbs can catch a buyers' eye. Mayfair, Kensington and Chelsea have long been the stomping ground of the elite -- and are now welcoming a new wave of African investors. "The Africans who are coming into London now are Africans who themselves have worked for their money," explains Bimpe Nkontchou, a British-Nigerian wealth manager based in London. "They have grown in industry and are actually part of the exciting story of the African renaissance," she continues. "It's bringing to London the best of the continent." These investors are having a considerable impact on London's property market and they mainly come from just six countries: Nigeria, Ghana, Congo, Gabon, Cameroon and Senegal. Of these, Nigerians are splashing out the most cash when it comes to bricks and mortar in the British capital -- typically spending between $22 and $37 million on securing a property, according to luxury property agents Beauchamp Estates. Their research shows that over the past three years Africans have spent over $900 million on luxury residential property in London. "The new international African is very well-traveled," explains Nkontchou. "Educated in the U.S., UK and different parts of Europe their taste is definitely more modern and clean." 'Safe-Haven' Owning a home in post codes like W1 or W8 -- around the corner from Kensington Palace -- means more than having a place to lay your head. These buildings are investments which are expected to gain even bigger value in the coming years. High-end auction house Sotheby's says that foreign investors see London as a "safe haven"  for prime property investments, and ranks the city as the second most important hub for ultra high-net-worth homes. The only spot more important on the planet is New York City. For evidence that London still attracts high-end buyers, look no further than the sale of a penthouse in Mayfair which fetched $40 million earlier this year. Educated thinking . As well as an intelligent investment, many of the African buyers see these houses as a way of maintaining long standing cultural ties with London -- and it's here they want to send their children to school. Harrow, Eton, Cheltenham Ladies College are all among the list of respected institutions that teach the offspring of wealthy Africans. The Nigerian Embassy in London calculates that Nigerian nationals now spend over $446 million per year on fees, tutoring and accommodation at British schools and university. "West African clients are very much driven by the need to educate their children," says Nkontchou. "Education usually means putting the children on an international stage, and that's one reason why this is feeding into the demand for property in London." Indeed, education industry experts ICEF Monitor say there were over 17,500 Nigerians studying in British universities in 2012  -- about 1,000 more than the 2009/10 academic session. And experts are expecting this trend to continue. "Virtually all the transactions are for end use, not rental investment, which indicates that the African buyer market in London has significant room for growth," says Gary Hersham, director at Beauchamp Estates. "African buyers or luxury tenants in London are currently where the Russians and Ukrainians were five years ago. They have the resources and desire to purchase or rental luxury homes in Prime Central London," he adds. "It is going to be the African century."More from Marketplace Africa .

Summary 2: Guided by wealth managers like Bimpe Nkontchou, African investors, especially Nigerians, are impacting London's property market, spending $22 to $37 million per property.

Jordan Speith is in prime position to win the Masters, maintaining the lead during the final round at Augusta. The 21-year-old has begun the last day of the hallowed tournament after setting a scoring record for 54 holes of 16 under par. He is playing alongside British contender Justin Rose in the final, showcase pairing, and will be looking to avoid the disappointment of last year, when he finished runner-up. Some of his American rivals, such as Tiger Woods, have slipped down the leaderboard. But others, including Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson are still posing a threat. Jordan Speith, pictured during his final round on Sunday, is in prime position to win The Masters, taking a four shot lead into the final round at Augusta . He is playing with British contender Justin Rose, who began the day four shots off the pace . Spieth, who squandered a front-nine Masters lead on Sunday last year and settled for sharing second behind Bubba Watson, is the man to beat for the top prize of $1.8 million at the $10 million event. 'Last year definitely left a bad taste in my mouth,' Spieth said. 'Looking at trying to get some revenge. I've got a long way to go still.' The spotlight belonged to Spieth, who could break Tiger Woods' 1997 tournament record of 18-under 270 by shooting 69 in the final round. The former world number one Woods started the day some shots back, and caused concern on the 7th hole when he seemed to injure his finger. He then pulled up on the 8th tee, shaking off the same hand while his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn watched from the crowds. If he wins, Spieth would become the second-youngest winner in Masters history, five months older than Woods when he won his first major in 1997. Spieth could also become only the fifth wire-to-wire winner in Masters history, joining Craig Wood in 1941, Arnold Palmer in 1960, Jack Nicklaus in 1972 and Ray Floyud in 1976. Spieth is the first player since Greg Norman in 1996 to own the outright Masters lead after each of the first three rounds, but Norman squandered a six-stroke lead in making the greatest last-day collapse in major golf history and lost by five to Nick Faldo. Tiger Woods  waits to play a shot on the first hole during the final round. He started the day further down the field looking to make up lost ground . The former world number one let go of his club and shook his hand after hurting his wrist during after playing a shot in pine needles . His girlfriend, gold medal skier Lindsey Vonn, was spotted walking up the first way as he got his round underway . She has been on hand to support her beau at Augusta throughout the week . No player in Masters history has ever reached 19-under at any stage of the tournament but Spieth flirted with it Saturday, making four birdies in five holes to stand 18-under before a double bogey at 17 and a 10-foot par save at 18, and could threaten again Sunday. With 22 birdies through 54 holes, Spieth broke Woods' record of 21 in 2005 and is on pace to shatter Mickelson's Masters 72-hole birdie total record of 25 from 2001. But Spieth has not made the Masters a runaway. Rose, who closed with five birdies in the last six holes Saturday, is trying for a second major crown - 22 months after his breakthrough at Merion. And Mickelson is still in position to potentially become the second-oldest winner in Masters history after Jack Nicklaus, who was 46 when he won in 1986. Mickelson has only one top-10 in his past 31 starts but it was a runner-up effort at last year's PGA Championship. Mickelson won the 2004, 2006 and 2010 Masters, as well as the 2005 PGA Championship and 2013 British Open. Should he win Sunday, he would match Faldo and Lee Trevino as six-time major champions. Spieth (above with girlfriend Annie Verret on her 21st birthday) is the first player since Greg Norman in 1996 to own the outright Masters lead after each of the first three rounds . On Saturday it was reported that the Dallas, Texas native has just bought $2.3million on a stunning Texas mansion and has a gorgeous girlfriend, Annie Verret, who also happens to be his high school sweetheart. Spieth grew up the oldest of three siblings to Shawn and Chris Spieth. Steven, Spieth's younger brother, is an athlete as well, and plays basketball for Brown University. Then there is his youngest sibling Ellie, who was born with a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum, and who has played the biggest role in shaping her brother's career according to Spieth's mother. She says Ellie helps the young superstar stay so grounded. 'Jordan wouldn't be where he's at today if he didn't grow up with Ellie,' said Mrs. Spieth in an interview with ESPN. 'Jordan realizes this isn't real life at the Masters. Trying to sit around and have dinner when his sister doesn't want to eat when everybody else is eating and has a fit, that's real life.' Spieth on his own website has said: 'Being Ellie's brother humbles me every day of my life.'

Summary 1: This article discusses the performance of Jordan Speith in the Masters tournament at Augusta. Speith is in a strong position to win, having set a scoring record and maintained the lead during the final round. He is playing alongside British contender Justin Rose and is looking to avoid the disappointment of last year when he finished as runner-up. Some of his American rivals have slipped down the leaderboard, but others still pose a threat.

Spain remains Britons' favourite destination to fly to, as it has been for more than 25 years, with its more than 34 million journeys in 2014 over double that of the next most popular, the United States. New figures from the UK Civil Aviation Authority shows 238m passengers passed through British airports in 2014, just three million less than the pre-recession boom peak of 241m in 2007 and 10m more (a 4.4 per cent rise) than 2013. As would be expected, most passengers (144m) fly to Europe which enjoyed a 5.4 per cent rise year on year in visitors from the UK. Perhaps surprisingly though, Germany proved a more visited destination even than France and Italy, which were all ranked behind Spain and the US and ahead of Ireland and the Netherlands. The United Arab Emirates also ranks in the top 10 countries British flyers most travel to and enjoyed the largest passenger increase in the past year with a 430,000 boost (7.4 per cent) to 6.2m. The UAE  ranked ahead of Portugal and Switzerland, who round out the top 10, and Turkey in 11th. While only the 12 most visited country by plane, Greece is the biggest improver over the past year with its 5.6 million incoming passengers from Britain a 13.2 per cent increase. While topping numerous polls as UK travellers' dream destination, Australia suffered the biggest drop in UK arrivals losing a third of visitors from 744,000 to 488,000. In Europe, the country with the largest fall in passengers was Poland with a minute drop of 0.1m to 5.2m. There has been a rise of 2.3 per cent in passengers flying to and from North America from the UK, which has now reached 21m per year.

There were a total of 2.1m landings and take-offs (air transport movements) of commercial flights in 2014, an increase of 1.1 per cent on 2013. While every London airport increased its passenger traffic in 2014, some regional areas suffered. Heathrow (a total of 73.4m up 1.4 per cent up on 2013), Gatwick (38.1m up 7.5 per cent), Luton (10.5m up 8.1 per cent) and London City (3.6m up 7.9 per cent). The biggest improvers were Southend with a 13.6 rise to 1.1m and Stansted with an increase of 11.7 per cent to 19.9m. Charter flights were another market to fall in 2014 with a 6 per cent (1.2m) fall from 2013 to 18.5m, in contrast to the scheduled flights increase of 4.2 per cent. 'Our latest passenger figures show that demand for air travel continues at a pace and is now just shy of the pre-recession peak reached in 2007,' CAA spokesperson Henry Killworth said. 'This is fantastic news for the UK's strong aviation industry and with the economy likely to grow further in 2015, we can expect even more passengers flying abroad this year. 'Our figures also show the UK's love affair with Spain continues unabated and remains the UK's favourite destination, which it has been every year since records began.'

A 13-year-old Indian girl faced with an arranged marriage has written a letter to her teacher begging her to stop the wedding (stock image above) A 13-year-old Indian girl faced with an arranged marriage has written a letter to her teacher begging her to stop the wedding. Duli Hembrom wrote to the principal of Milan Mithi Uchha Vidyalaya after failing to convince her parents to call off the wedding, which is due to take place in two days. She wrote: 'I do not want to get married, I took an oath at the time of admission that I will not get married before I turn 18.' She added that she wanted the teacher to stop the marriage 'whichever way possible', the India Times reported. It is thought the 'oath' Duli refers to is the school's promise she had to make when she started, but exactly what it included is not known. Her father Lachhu, who lives in Gudibanda with Duli's mother, said child marriage was a common phenomenon in their society. He told the Hindustan Times that it was difficult to find a suitable match for a grown-up girl. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed in India during British rule in 1929, specified that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. But the country has the second highest number of child marriages, according to a UN report. Nearly 52 per cent of girls are married before reaching 18 years old, Indian records show. Between 2011 and 2020 more than 140 million girls will become child brides globally, analysts estimate. Aarati Benera, a women’s rights activist, described child marriage as 'illegal and a social evil'. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed in India during British rule in 1929, specified that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. Above, women and girls sit waiting to be married in a mass wedding ceremony in India . Despite numerous campaigns from many of the world's largest charities and NGOs, the issue of child brides remains a global concern. In 2013 there were around 57.5 million child brides across the world, 40 per cent of which married in India. This is despite the Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed  during British rule in 1929, specifying that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. Meanwhile, in Africa, 42 per cent of girls were married before turning 18 compared to 29 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean. The number of child brides is estimated to rise to 140 million by 2020 if current trends continue, 18.5 million of which will be under 15 years old, analysts warn. Statistics show that girls living in poor households are almost twice as likely to marry before 18 than girls in higher income households. And girls younger than 15 are also five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their 20s. Aarati Benera, a women’s rights activist, described child marriage as 'illegal and a social evil'.

Summary 1: Duli Hembrom, 13, implores her school, Milan Mithi Uchha Vidyalaya, to prevent her arranged marriage, a common practice in India, where 52 per cent of girls marry before 18, despite the 1929 Child Marriage Restraint Act. The India Times and a UN report highlight India's high child marriage rates. Aarati Benera, a women’s rights activist, condemns child marriage, with 140 million expected globally by 2020, including 57.5 million in India.

Summary 2: Duli Hembrom, 13, seeks help from Milan Mithi Uchha Vidyalaya to stop her arranged marriage, a widespread issue in India where 52% of girls marry before 18, despite the 1929 Child Marriage Restraint Act. The India Times, UN report, and activist Aarati Benera highlight the global issue, with 140 million expected child brides by 2020, 57.5 million in India, 42% in Africa, and 29% in Latin America and the Caribbean, including 18.5 million under 15.

Summary 3: Duli Hembrom, a 13-year-old Indian student, has appealed to her school, Milan Mithi Uchha Vidyalaya, to halt her imminent arranged marriage, as reported by the India Times. Despite the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929, India has the second highest number of child marriages globally, according to a UN report. Women's rights activist, Aarati Benera, labels child marriage as 'illegal and a social evil'.

Summary 4: This article discusses a 13-year-old Indian girl named Duli Hembrom who is pleading with her teacher at Milan Mithi Uchha Vidyalaya to prevent her impending arranged marriage. Despite the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929, which stipulates that girls must be 18 and boys 21 to marry, child marriage remains prevalent in India. Duli's father, Lachhu, asserts that child marriage is a common societal practice, making it difficult for Duli to avoid.

Famous Italian designers like Fendi, Gucci and Prada may be toted by celebrities such as Rihanna, Kate Moss and Katy Perry, but few are probably aware of the history behind the brands they wear. A new book has now archived the changing face of Italian fashion, from the post-war years to the 21st century. Italian Glamour: The Essence of Italian Fashion, From the Postwar Years to the Present Day, captures the evolution of Mediterranean style through 300 iconic dresses and archived images. Model Joan Olsen (left) shows off bold linear prints in an outfit by haute couture designer/artist Livio de Simone in 1954. Co-author Enrico says that Italian glamour is not 'sophisticated or artificial' The book was compiled by Enrico Quinto and Paolo Tinarelli - the two men who  were the first to introduce the concept of vintage style in Italy . The volume has been compiled by Enrico Quinto, 51, and Paolo Tinarelli, 49. The two men established the first flea market in Rome and were the first to introduce the concept of vintage in Italy. Enrico revealed that they wanted to honour the Italian designers who have helped to make the country a fashion powerhouse. He said: 'The pioneers that have really put Italy on the map of international fashion have been Emilio Pucci in the Fifties, Missoni and Krizia in the Sixties, Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace in the Seventies and Eighties, and Dolce & Gabbana, Prada and Gucci in the Nineties.' Fifties cover girl Ivy Nicholson wears Emilio Pucci in Capri, 1953. The book talks about how the start of many Italian fashion powerhouses started out with a real focus on craftsmanship . The book focuses on the humble beginnings of some of the world's biggest Italian brands and how they rose to cultural significance. It  looks at how designers such as Miuccia Prada, Giorgio Armani and Adele Casagrande, founder of Fendi, have created a legacy within their labels. Many Italian powerhouses started out with a focus on craftsmanship, using work methods and decorative traditions that were passed down through generations. Post-war economic development in the fifties saw the expansion of the advertising industry into high fashion. Designers such as Alma Maria Lami constructed clothes that were decorated with a patchwork of ideas and activities . The book also explores momentous periods which truly characterised Italian fashion. For example, post-war economic development in the Fifties saw the expansion of the advertising industry into high fashion. Designers like Alma Maria Lami constructed clothes that were decorated with patchworks of cartoon-like ideas and activities, which subtly influenced buyers. A woman wears a structural suit by Fernandi, at a time when Italian fashion was beginning to break away from Parisian style . In the mid-fifties, Emilio Frederico Schuberth created an outfit which had a removable over-skirt so that the wearer could opt for a straight or flared silhouette . Another poignant moment came in the mid-Fifties, where Italian fashion began to break away from what Parisian style dictated. Creative directors such as Emilio Frederico Schuberth began to create structurally innovative creations. Italian Glamour also looks at breakthrough moments for Italian fashion, such as one of the first runway showcases in Florence, which saw the artistic city overtake Paris as the global fashion capital. From that moment on, styles quickly progressed. By the mid-Forties, Italian designers began to take their inspiration from Hollywood femme fatales rather than Parisian fashion. Religion was also an inspiration, which explains the high-necks and dark tones often seen in that period.

Religion was also an inspiration, which explains the high-necks and dark tones . Model Liliana Mongini wears Germana Marucelli in January 1950. Marucelli was the first Italian post-war designer - her designs were on several occasions interpreted by Christian Dior . In fact, Parisian fashion soon began to follow the lead of Italian innovators. Germana Marucelli was the first Italian post-war designer, and her designs were, on several occasions, interpreted by Frenchman Christian Dior. The book also examines how trends developed over the years and iconic celebrity moments that would cement a designer's fame. One in particular came in 1956, when Italian-French film star Sophia Loren wore a sweeping gown by Emilio Schuberth at the Cannes Festival. Schuberth became known as the 'tailor to the stars', and also catered for the likes of Rita Hayworth and Brigitte Bardot. His students included Valentino Garavani - who continues to be an Italian powerhouse today.

This dress by Emilio Schuberth cemented his position as 'tailor to the stars' Late sixties and early seventies creations from Fendi, including the bag with the signature interlocking Fs (right) Examples of humble beginnings are especially surprisingly when looking at labels such as Fendi - who originally came into existence as a leather and fur shop in Rome. From the mid-Sixties, Karl Lagerfeld was involved in the design of Fendi's logo with the interlocking F letters. Several designers in the book, such as Federico Forquet, are no longer operational, but were important in influencing and shaping the overall movement and progression of Italian fashion. The book also highlights how certain Italian designers, such as Roberto Carpucci, were propelled to fame when clothes were featured in advertorials - eventually appearing in publications such as Vogue. A piece from Italian designer Federico Forquet, in his autumn/winter 1965 collection . Renowned Italian designer, Roberto Carpucci's structural designs featured in Vogue Italia in 1982 . A defining moment for Italian fashion was circa 1994; Elizabeth Hurley stepped out in a Versace safety pin gown that was to become one of the most iconic dresses of all time. From then on, it seemed that Italian fashion was the pinnacle of daring style. Co-author of the book, Enrico Quinto says that Italian glamour is 'in the DNA of an Italian's lifestyle'. He adds: 'Italian glamour is not sophisticated or artificial; it keeps conscious of the female's body, and it works in the same way as the idea of 'Dolce Far Niente' - the sweetness of doing nothing. It's an accessible beauty - simple and natural.' Elizabeth Hurley in 1994 (left), pictured with then-beau, Hugh Grant (right) wearing the Versace dress that would go down in fashion history . Liz Hurley's dress (pictured) was a creation from Gianni Versace's spring/summer 1994 collection . In fact, Italian style has made a huge contribution to the fashion industry today, with Milan Fashion Week still a crucial part of the circuit, and with young models such as Kendall Jenner flocking to Milan every year. Popular culture figures such as Rihanna, are also active lovers of the Italian style. Rihanna recently customised a Fendi Baguette bag for a charity auction, along with Sarah Jessica Parker. Rihanna toting not one but two of her customised Baguette bags with Fendi at the launch . Successful models such as Kendall Jenner (pictured) flock to Milan Fashion Week every season to walk in shows such as Dolce & Gabbana (left - Autumn/Winter 2015, right - Spring/Summer 2015). Italian style is very much still crucial to the fashion landscape . In terms of the state of Italian glamour now, Enrico argues that it is a changing landscape, but something that maintains its simplicity. 'Italy has become more global and the melting pot of different nationalities has automatically brought new influences into Italy's lifestyle. 'I believe that  the essence of Italian glamour is based on a certain 'minimalism'. Clothing still has to be practical and adapted to an understated lifestyle. Italian Glamour: The Essence of Italian Fashion, From the Postwar Years to the Present Day (Skira Editore) is out on 30 March 2015.

Summary 1: Quinto and Tinarelli's 'Italian Glamour' traces Italian fashion's evolution, spotlighting designers like Pucci, Missoni, Krizia, Armani, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Prada, Gucci, and Fendi's Adele Casagrande.

(CNN)You know the phrase "dodging a bullet"? Forget about it. Probably not going to happen anymore. The U.S. military said this week it has made great progress in its effort to develop a self-steering bullet. In February, the "smart bullets" -- .50-caliber projectiles equipped with optical sensors -- passed their most successful round of live-fire tests to date, according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In the tests, an experienced marksman "repeatedly hit moving and evading targets," a DARPA statement said. "Additionally," the statement said, "a novice shooter using the system for the first time hit a moving target." In other words, now you don't even have to be a good shot to hit the mark. The system has been developed by DARPA's Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance program, known as EXACTO. "True to DARPA's mission, EXACTO has demonstrated what was once thought impossible: the continuous guidance of a small-caliber bullet to target," said Jerome Dunn, DARPA program manager. "This live-fire demonstration from a standard rifle showed that EXACTO is able to hit moving and evading targets with extreme accuracy at sniper ranges unachievable with traditional rounds. Fitting EXACTO's guidance capabilities into a small .50-caliber size is a major breakthrough and opens the door to what could be possible in future guided projectiles across all calibers," Dunn said. Videos supplied by DARPA show the bullets making sharp turns in midair as they pursue their targets. It all conjures up images of a cartoon character frantically fleeing a bullet that follows him wherever he goes. Only, these bullets are traveling at hundreds of miles per hour. And even the Road Runner can't run that fast. DARPA says the smart bullets will also help shooters who are trying, for example, to hit targets in high winds. The goals of the EXACTO program are giving shooters accuracy at greater distances, engaging targets sooner and enhancing the safety of American  troops, DARPA said.

Summary 1: DARPA's EXACTO program, under the U.S. military, has developed a .50-caliber self-steering 'smart bullet'. Jerome Dunn, a program manager, confirmed its ability to make sharp turns in midair to hit moving targets with extreme accuracy, even in high winds. This breakthrough in guided projectiles enhances the safety of American troops and even allows novice shooters to hit targets.

Summary 2: The U.S. military, through DARPA's EXACTO program, has made strides in creating a self-steering bullet. Jerome Dunn, a DARPA program manager, stated that the .50-caliber 'smart bullets' demonstrated unprecedented accuracy in hitting moving targets during live-fire tests, even when operated by a novice shooter. These bullets, equipped with optical sensors, represent a major breakthrough in guided projectiles.

Summary 3: The U.S. military's EXACTO program, managed by Jerome Dunn at DARPA, has developed a .50-caliber 'smart bullet' capable of continuous guidance to targets. This bullet can make sharp midair turns, hitting moving targets at sniper ranges, even in high winds. The bullet's behavior, enhancing American troops' safety, is likened to a cartoon character being pursued.

Summary 4: This article discusses the U.S. military's recent advancements in developing a self-steering bullet. The 'smart bullets', as they are referred to, have successfully passed live-fire tests conducted by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). These bullets are equipped with optical sensors and can hit moving targets with high accuracy, even when used by a novice shooter.

Dick Advocaat will not make the same mistake he did during his first season at Rangers by playing down the significance of the Old Firm derby. The 67-year-old takes charge of Sunderland for the first time on home soil tomorrow with North-East adversaries Newcastle the visitors. It was back in 1998 that Advocaat said the Old Firm clash was just another game. Celtic won 5-1 and the Dutch boss was criticised by fans and the media for under-estimating the intensity of the rivalry. Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat insists he will not underestiamte the signficance of the Wear-Tyne Derby . Advocaat and assistant manager Paul Bracewell oversee training ahead of Sunday's crucial derby fixture . Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe (centre) trains with his team-mates ahead of the game with Newcastle . Rangers' Rod Wallace (centre) runs forward with the ball as his side are thrashed 5-1 by Celtic in 1998 . Advocaat had failed to recognise the significance of the Old Firm fixture and this led to a humiliating loss . He recalled: 'To be honest, I did not realise at that moment it was so huge. 'We lost that game and I remember saying in the press conference when they were really upset, 'It is no problem for me because it is just one of 38 games and we will not lose any more'. 'I would not say that anymore! But we became champions that year, six points ahead of Celtic, and won the treble.' Advocaat, though, does admit that his thoughts are trained on three points and not the notion of regional bragging rights. Indeed, the Black Cats are one point above the relegation zone and could be in the bottom three by kick-off. 'Every game is a chance to get a result – and that starts on Sunday,' said Advocaat, who could start Adam Johnson for the first time following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. Sunderland's Adam Johnson was recently arrested on suspicion of sexual activity with an under-age girl . Advocaat is still considering starting the 27-year-old England international in the Wear-Tyne derby . 'If we win the fans might like me, yes, but I would prefer it if they loved me at the end of the season because that would mean we have stayed up.' Sunderland have won just twice at home all season. They have struggled amid an atmosphere of unrest at the Stadium of Light, but that should change tomorrow given the unveiling of Advocaat and the opponents. 'For us, this must be a weapon,' said Advocaat when asked about the home crowd. 'That is the reason I said it is so important to get them behind us, because it is an extra weapon. If the players feel that, they will give even more and I expect that the fans will do that. This is a special game.' Sunderland midfielder Will Buckley (centre) dribbles with the ball during training at the Academy of Light .

Summary 1: Dick Advocaat, Sunderland's manager, is preparing for a pivotal Newcastle match at the Stadium of Light, with the support of the home crowd and assistant Paul Bracewell. Despite Adam Johnson's recent arrest for suspected sexual activity with a minor, he may play. Advocaat's focus is on escaping relegation, not regional bragging rights, despite only two home wins this season.

Summary 2: Dick Advocaat, Sunderland's manager, is preparing for a crucial game against Newcastle, learning from his past mistake of underestimating the Old Firm derby, which led to a 5-1 loss to Celtic. Assisted by Paul Bracewell, Advocaat is focused on securing a win to keep Sunderland above the relegation zone.

Summary 3: Sunderland's manager, Dick Advocaat, assisted by Paul Bracewell, is gearing up for a key match against Newcastle at the Stadium of Light. Learning from a past 5-1 loss to Celtic, Advocaat may start Adam Johnson, despite recent controversy. The home crowd's support is seen as crucial for Sunderland's fight against relegation.

Summary 4: This article discusses Dick Advocaat, the 67-year-old manager of Sunderland, and his approach to the Old Firm derby. He previously downplayed the significance of the game during his first season at Rangers, a mistake he insists he will not repeat. The article also mentions Sunderland's precarious position just above the relegation zone.

With house prices soaring, it's not easy finding somewhere to live. And this community has thrown in the towel. Meet Seattle's rolling neighborhood of RVs, where each unassuming vehicle is a capsule home. The unusual format has been captured in a series of photographs by visual journalist Anna Erickson. Meet Bud Dodson, 57, and welcome to his home: An RV in Seattle's SoDo where he watches over the parking lot in exchange for a spot . No place like home: John Warden, 52, has turned his $200 vehicle into his home after his apartment burned down years ago . There are around 30 drivers that float in and out of this parking lot in the SoDo (South of Downtown) area of the city in Washington State. One might not notice them in the mornings as hundreds of workers in the nearby factories, such as Starbucks, park up and rush into work. But on the weekends, as the rabble flocks back to their beds, this unique group remains. John Worden, 52, has been living in his vehicle for years since his apartment burned down and he was left homeless. He told Anna his car cost $200, and doesn't drive very well. But for a home, it's just about enough. Though plan on the outside, it is a Pandora's Box inside, Anna tells DailyMail.com. 'It was scattered with trinkets that he had been collecting over the years,' she explained, 'and a pile of beer cans that he was saving to turn in for money.' For work, he panhandles while helping people find parking spaces at Safeco Field stadium, where he used to be a cook. People come and go for work in the factories nearby, but on the weekend it is just the RV-dwellers that area left . Daily life: Here Bud can be seen preparing himself a barbecue on the gravel outside his capsule home, one of about 30 in the community . Eclectic: While Bud's RV is organized and functional, John's is full of trinkets and belongings dating back years . Alongside him - most of the time - is Bud Dodson, 57. While some are forced to move about regularly, Dodson, a maintenance man, looks after the parking lot in exchange for a semi-permanent spot. His home has its own unique stamp on it. 'He had really made the RV his home and taken good care of it,' Anna described. 'It was more functional [than John's] and a cleaner space with a bed, kitchen and bathroom.' Whether organized or eclectic, however, each one is home. 'None of them seem to want to move on,' Anna said. 'It's not perfect but they seem pretty content. Move in, move out: Some have agreements to stay, but others have to keep driving around to find a spot . John works as a panhandler at Safeco Fields stadium, where he used to work as a cook . He is content with his life in between the usual confines of society . Personal: To many this may just seem like a parking lot but for these men it is a very personal space . 'Bud is very grateful, he said the parking lot owner is just such a nice guy to let him live like this.' She came across them when she stopped to ask a seemingly homeless man for directions. 'We got talking,' she said, 'and he mentioned that he lived nearby in an RV. I went round to look and there was a whole bunch of them.' Curious, she spent about two months returning to the spot, meeting with the community and building their trust. 'These RVs are their homes so it's a very personal thing,' she explained.

Summary 1: Anna Erickson's photos reveal a community of 30 RV dwellers in Seattle's SoDo, near Starbucks and other factories. Residents like Bud Dodson, who maintains an organized RV in a semi-permanent spot in exchange for overseeing the parking lot, and John Warden, living in a $200 vehicle filled with collected trinkets after his apartment burned down, have adapted to this unconventional lifestyle, finding contentment despite the challenges.

Summary 2: This article discusses a unique community in Seattle's SoDo area, where individuals have turned RVs into their homes.

Samantha Cameron has made her first solo appearance of the general election with a provocative visit to a Ukip stronghold. The Prime Minister's wife swooped into Rochester and Strood, the seat held by Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories last summer. David Cameron has made no secret of his desire to kick Mr Reckless's 'fat arse' out of the Commons, and clearly hopes his wife can woo voters in the crucial Kent battleground. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron has made her first solo appearance of the general election with a provocative visit to a Ukip stronghold . Mrs Cameron joined Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst for a visit to Abbey Court School in Rainham, Kent . Mrs Cameron met Mitchell, aged four, at the Abbey Court School in Rainham, a special school  for three to 19-year-olds . She also spoke to five-year-old Jessica at the school, which aides said was 'very close to her heart' Mrs Cameron's first solo appearance three days into the campaign will be seen as a statement of intent from the Conservatives, who are desperate to wrest the seat back from Ukip following the by-election. Visiting a special school in the constituency, she joked that she was pleased that her campaigning duties did not stretch to a live TV debate. Mr Cameron is due to go head-to-head in a seven-way debate tomorrow night with the leaders of Labour, Lib Dems, Ukip, Greens, SNP and Plaid Cymru. Mrs Cameron told reporters: 'He doesn't seem too nervous but I'm very glad it's him doing it and not me.' When Mr Reckless defected from the Tories last year, the Prime Minister launched an extraordinary attack on his betrayal. Mr Cameron argued that committed volunteers have ‘knocked on doors, stuffed envelopes, licked stamps to get his fat arse on the Commons benches, and this is how he repays them’. But after the Conservatives threw the kitchen sink at the by-election triggered by his decision to join Ukip, Mr Reckless held it with a majority of 2,920. Tory sources said it remains a 'key seat' and Mrs Cameron was keen to support Miss Tolhurst who is a 'great local candidate' Mrs Cameron is expected to make a series of more stridently political interventions, after using a BBC interview last month to back her husband's bid to remain as Prime Minister . Tory sources said it remains a 'key seat' and Mrs Cameron was keen to support Tory Kelly Tolhurst who is a 'great local candidate'. Mrs Cameron is expected to make a series of more stridently political interventions, after using a BBC interview last month to back her husband's bid to remain as Prime Minister.

Miss Tolhurst who stood against Mr Reckless at the Rochester and Strood by-election in November. She greeted Mrs Cameron as she arrived for the visit to Abbey Court School in Rainham, Kent. Mrs Cameron wore a Cos raspberry coloured blouse and a blue skirt from Toast, teamed with navy shoes from Zara. She met head teacher Karen Joy as she toured the site for three to 19-year-olds with special educational needs, which aides said was 'very close to her heart'. Mark Reckless defected from the Tories to Ukip last summer. After the Conservatives threw the kitchen sink at the subsequent by-election, Mr Reckless held it with a majority of 2,920 . In September, Mr Reckless followed Douglas Carswell to become the second Conservative to defect to Ukip. The turncoat MP was unrepentant about his defection, insisting the Tories had broken promises on immigration and reducing the deficit. Senior Conservatives reacted with fury.  Party chairman Grant Shapps used the opening speech of the Tory conference to mount a sustained attack on Mr Reckless, declaring: ‘He lied and lied and lied again.’ Mr Cameron has admitted that the pressures of wooing voters means their regular date nights will have to be put on hold. He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I think that will probably be a bit testing. I think there won't be much time for some of those things. 'Samantha's going to be on the campaign trail with me. She has also got other things she has to do, including making sure the children make it to school every day.' In November's by-election, Mr Reckless won 42 per cent of the vote, ahead of Kelly Tolhurst on 35 per cent . Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne today visited Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton . The Tory power couple were filmed together at the weekend during a visit to Salford's Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester. Speaking to a patient, they discussed their many hospital visits with son Ivan, who died in 2009. The PM said: 'When our son was very ill, we often went into hospital and it is very difficult to get out at the weekend.' Mrs Cameron added: 'On a Friday, if we thought there was any chance that we could get home, I was like: 'We've got to get out this afternoon'.'

Summary 1: This article discusses Samantha Cameron's first solo appearance during the general election.

Article:
England must have played against worse teams than this St Kitts Invitational XI but, after a day that descended into near farce, it is difficult to think of any. Warm-up games can be low-key affairs but there cannot have been many times when an international side have been pitched against a team as bad as this. St Kitts were simply shambolic, so bad that Chigwell Cricket Club could give them a decent game, and an almost tragic example of the steep decline of Caribbean cricket. They were simply not fit for purpose. Jos Buttler appeals for a stumping as England dominated the second day of a farcical match in St Kitts . Mark Wood looked lively in his early spell after he was brought in for his first bowl for England . The statistics will say that England, having bowled St Kitts out for 59 on the first day of their opening two-day tour match, rattled up 379 for six declared with both Alastair Cook and Ian Bell retiring out. Then St Kitts, given just one session to hang on, capitulated again and finished on 76 for seven, narrowly avoiding handing England a hollow victory. The match was drawn, just about, and it should also have been hung and quartered. The modern fixture madness that will see England play 17 Tests in the next 10 months makes proper warm-ups almost impossible and is one of the main reasons why home teams nearly always win Test series these days. But when they are as meaningless as this it is questionable why it is even worth bothering. England may have spent time in the middle but they may as well have just turned up in Antigua next week to play the first of three Tests. Wood celebrates his first England wicket, but he is probably still a way off getting a first Test cap . Alastair Cook acknowledges the crowd after making a century, shortly before being retired out . Jos Battler had a short go at attacking the home bowlers before England declared with a mammoth 320 lead . For what it is worth, Bell and Joe Root made untroubled half-centuries yesterday after Cook had moved to his first century for England since the Ashes warm-up in Hobart 18 months ago and promptly retired. Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler then had a bit of a bash before England declared at the fall of Stokes just before tea, the small matter of 320 ahead. Then, in a move which further devalued the authenticity of the ‘contest,’ England brought Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood into the match for a work out. Wood, the Durham fast bowler, looked lively in his first bowl for England off his minimalist run-up and earned his first wicket when he bowled Shane Jeffers but it is unlikely to be enough to earn him a first Test cap just yet. Gary Ballance looked out of touch, the only real problem for England in a very comfortable match . Liam Plunkett charges in as England reduced their hosts to 24 for six in farcical circumstances . When St Kitts plummeted to 24 for six and almost had a batsman timed out before he emerged just in time with the Velcro on his pads barely fastened, the home side’s embarrassment was almost complete. Yet at least they regained a semblance of pride by holding on as England gave their two spinners a decent bowl, Akeem Saunders and Leon Clarke doing most to keep England at bay. The only place in England’s first Test team yet to be decided, it seems, is between Adil Rashid and James Tredwell for the sole spinner’s slot and Tredwell was the clear winner here, taking three wickets to Rashid’s one. The Yorkshireman will need to have a very good second match to edge out Tredwell. James Tredwell (left) outperformed Adil Rashid in the contest to be England's Test spinner next week . Buttler makes an unconventional stop as England came close to winning the game in just two days . The only concern for England will be the form of Gary Ballance who looked out of touch before falling for 16, the legacy perhaps of a World Cup where he somehow became a symbol of England’s unimaginative one-day thinking. England’s desperate attempt to get as much as they can from the second of these two warm-ups will tomorrow see them bowl 90 overs at St Kitts whatever happens and then bat for 90 overs on Thursday. The first cricket score of 225 for 25 could be recorded at Warner Park tomorrow and the once proud reputation of Caribbean cricket will most likely take another hit. Truly, it is a sad state of affairs.

Summary 1: England's cricket team dominated a farcical match against the St Kitts Invitational XI, reflecting the decline of Caribbean cricket. Standout performances included Alastair Cook and Ian Bell, who both retired out, and Mark Wood, who made his first bowl for England. Despite the poor quality of the opposition, the match served as a warm-up for England's busy schedule of international matches, although its value is questioned.

Summary 2: This article discusses a cricket match between England and the St Kitts Invitational XI. The match was described as a farce due to the poor performance of the St Kitts team, which is seen as a reflection of the decline of Caribbean cricket. England dominated the match, with St Kitts barely avoiding a defeat. The article suggests that such low-quality warm-up matches are not beneficial for teams like England, who have a busy schedule of international matches.

Summary 3: England's cricket team, featuring standout performances from Alastair Cook, Ian Bell, and Mark Wood, dominated a farcical match against the St Kitts Invitational XI, a reflection of Caribbean cricket's decline. Gary Ballance's form was a concern, while James Tredwell outperformed Adil Rashid in the contest for England's Test spinner slot. The match's value as a warm-up for England's packed international schedule is questioned.

Summary 4: England's cricket team, with notable performances from Alastair Cook, Ian Bell, Mark Wood, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler, and Liam Plunkett, dominated a farcical match against the St Kitts Invitational XI, indicative of Caribbean cricket's decline. Gary Ballance's form was a concern, while James Tredwell outshone Adil Rashid for England's Test spinner slot. The match's value as a warm-up for England's busy international schedule is questioned.

Kent Sprouse acknowledged almost immediately after he was arrested more than a decade ago that he killed a police officer and another man outside a Dallas-area convenience store. A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. No new appeals are pending as Sprouse's lethal injection scheduled for Thursday evening approaches. He would be the fifth inmate executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row: Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) andcustomer  Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said a recent purchase of pentobarbital means they have enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.

Summary 1: This article discusses the case of Kent Sprouse, who was convicted for the murder of Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt and a customer named Pedro Moreno at a convenience store in Dallas. Sprouse admitted to the killings shortly after his arrest and was sentenced to death in 2004. His appeals, which were unsuccessful, focused on his mental health at the time of the murders. Sprouse's execution is scheduled for Thursday evening, making him the fifth inmate to be executed in Texas this year.

Summary 2: Kent Sprouse, set for execution at Huntsville Unit prison, was convicted for murdering Officer Steinfeldt and Pedro Moreno at Ferris Food Mart in Dallas using a shotgun. Post-arrest, he admitted guilt, but his appeals, arguing mental illness from illegal drugs, failed. His execution, following a rejected insanity defense and life prison term plea, will be Texas's fifth this year.

Summary 3: Kent Sprouse, due for lethal injection at Huntsville prison, was convicted for the shotgun murders of Officer Steinfeldt and Pedro Moreno at Ferris Food Mart, Dallas. Despite admitting guilt and arguing drug-induced mental illness, his appeals failed. His execution, following a rejected insanity defense and life term plea, will be Texas's fifth this year, with pentobarbital supplies sufficient for three more scheduled in May and June.

Summary 4: Kent Sprouse, convicted for killing Officer Marty Steinfeldt and Pedro Moreno at a Dallas convenience store, Ferris Food Mart, is scheduled for execution. Sprouse, who used a shotgun for the murders, admitted his guilt post-arrest. His unsuccessful appeals centered on his mental state, influenced by illegal drugs. His execution will mark the fifth in Texas this year.

Article:
Two goals within ninety seconds of each other was enough to spark an outbreak of fear and loathing rarely seen on this side of the Mersey. After more than two years of inexorable decline the patience of Tranmere's faithful finally snapped when Oxford moved decisively ahead, in an effortless manner reminiscent of the previous Saturday's Boat Race. The loathing was directed mainly at manager Micky Adams, who was announced on Sunday morning to have left the club by 'mutual consent'. The Tranmere players look down after the final whistle, as the prospect of relegation looms large . This is how it ends in football sometimes: standing in the dugout having a season ticket thrown in your face by an incandescent supporter, who you then see given a standing ovation by some sections upon being escorted out. The fear involves dropping out of the Football League a week on Saturday after 94 years of membership, something which provoked an angry demonstration by some 150 supporters outside the gates afterwards. Adams departs with two games to go and after a 3-0 defeat against a thoroughly professional Oxford side the Wirral's only professional sports outfit are one point behind Cheltenham and two behind Hartlepool. Bitter ironies abound. Relegation to the National League – the grand-sounding new title for the Conference but don't be fooled – may partly be down to Prenton Park legend and ex-manager Ronnie Moore, sacked by the club last season for a minor betting offence, and now masterminding Hartlepool's unlikely survival. And it could all happen under the ownership of former FA Chief Executive Mark Palios, knowledgeable football man and esteemed former Tranmere player who took over the club late last summer. Kemar Roofe celebrates scoring, as a professional Oxford side eased past sorry Tranmere . The battle between Barnet and Bristol Rovers to win automatic promotion to the Football League will go down to the last game. Barnet, who lead the Conference by one point, have a home game against mid-table Gateshead on Saturday while Rovers face a potentially more difficult match at home against fourth from bottom Alfreton, who almost certainly need to win themselves to avoid being relegated. Rovers looked as if they would head the table after the weekend’s games but conceded a goal with two minutes left to draw 1-1 at Dover. That put Barnet, who dropped out of the Football League two seasons ago, in the driving seat after a 1-1 draw away to Kidderminster. Grimsby are guaranteed a play-off spot, but one of Eastleigh, Forest Green and Macclesfield will miss out. It all seemed such a good idea at the time. Nobody questioned his judgement in October when, with the team bottom of the table, he replaced the inexperienced Rob Edwards with a seasoned operator like Adams. There was the odd dead cat bounce, but six months on they are still bottom after failing to keep a clean sheet for nineteen consecutive matches. The Mersey ferry displays a quicker turning circle than that shown by the home defence for the two killer goals that came just after half-time, but then a cause of that may be a lack of familiarity among players. A staggering 52 have been called up to first team duty this season. Adams played the selection and recruitment game like a man on the fruit machine, continually pulling the handle in the hope that the right combination would come up in alignment. The latest loan signing has been young Everton winger George Green who, when pulled off on Saturday after 60 minutes, could be seen haranguing some of his team-mates on the bench. It was not long after full-time that you could catch assistant manager Alan Rogers, part of a distinguished list of former Tranmere players who graduated to a higher level, stripping the paint from the dressing room walls. Micky Adams has left the club by mutual consent, with Tranmere bottom of the league with two games to go . Rogers – now in charge for the next fortnight – then had to deny that Adams's decision to dodge the media was of any significance. He then professed himself 'dumbfounded' by the team's performance. And so it unravels in desperate times. They had actually competed gamely in the first half, but were overwhelmed by anxiety when getting anywhere near the goal. 'It's not acceptable,' he said. 'We just don't look like scoring a goal. The players have got to start taking some responsibility. It's an easy option pointing fingers at the manager but the players have got to look at themselves, have they done enough? The answer is no. I was a player. You've got to stand up and be counted.' Marc Laird, well-travelled journeyman and among those fighting for his career, did not try to shift the blame onto the management. He just about summed up the sense of disbelief saying: 'It's a big club, when I joined in the summer I never imagined that we would be where we are.' The prospect of dropping out of the 92 is something uniquely grim in English football, especially for a club of this heritage, who shortly after joining the league gave a debut to 16 year-old local lad Dixie Dean. It was only in January 2013 that they stood on top of League One and early in the last decade reached the League Cup final plus three FA Cup sixth rounds. But they do not have to look far for examples of how there is no easy road back in the event of relegation. Aside from Southport and Chester there is Wrexham, not far across the Welsh border and a decent sized club, who fell out of the league in 2008 and have yet to return. There is a long trip to Plymouth next Saturday and then a last home game against Bury. The unpalatable odds are that the next stop after that could be somewhere like Braintree or Dover.

Summary 1: Tranmere's loss to Oxford triggered Micky Adams' exit and relegation fears, with ex-manager Ronnie Moore leading Hartlepool's survival under Mark Palios' ownership. Barnet and Bristol Rovers vie for promotion after Rob Edwards' replacement by Adams. Everton winger George Green's recent signing, assistant manager Alan Rogers' frustration, and player Marc Laird's disbelief underscore the team's crisis.

Summary 2: Tranmere's defeat to Oxford and Micky Adams' departure has sparked relegation fears. Ex-manager Ronnie Moore's Hartlepool survival and owner Mark Palios' leadership add to the irony. Meanwhile, Barnet and Bristol Rovers' battle for automatic promotion intensifies. The team's decline began under Rob Edwards, replaced by Adams when Tranmere was at the bottom of the table.

Summary 3: Tranmere's loss to Oxford, leading to manager Micky Adams' exit, has fans fearing relegation after 94 years in the Football League. The team's decline is ironically linked to ex-manager Ronnie Moore, who was sacked for a minor betting offence and is now leading Hartlepool's survival. The club, under the ownership of former FA Chief Executive Mark Palios, faces a grim future.

Summary 4: This article discusses a football match between Tranmere and Oxford, which resulted in a significant loss for Tranmere. The defeat led to the departure of Tranmere's manager, Micky Adams, and sparked fear among the team's supporters about the possibility of relegation. The article also mentions the reaction of the fans, who expressed their disappointment and anger towards the team's performance.

It is a remarkable, eye-popping portrait of Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Entitled 'Naughty Nicola', the painting depicts her as a dominatrix in a short red dress, black suspenders on display and whip in hand. But instead of being offended, Ms Sturgeon is 'tickled' by the image, so much so it is believed to grace the wall of her suburban Glasgow home after she was given it as a birthday gift by her husband, Peter Murrell. He is the man credited with transforming the nationalist leader from surly apparatchik to national stateswoman – on the brink of holding the balance of power. Eye-popping: The painting allegedly hanging in the home of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon shows her as a dominatrix (pictured) Couple: The image is said to grace the wall of Sturgeon's (left) suburban Glasgow home after she was given it as a birthday gift by her husband, Peter Murrell (right) Softly spoken, bespectacled and almost unknown outside the Scottish political village, he can walk the busiest streets in Scotland without being recognised. SNP colleagues reveal that within the party, Murrell is affectionately nicknamed Penfold, after Danger Mouse's loyal hamster sidekick in the 1980s cartoon series. Meek, myopic and chubby, Penfold dutifully shouts 'Coming chief', whenever his superior summons him in the cartoons. Some say the similarity extends further. Sturgeon doesn't drive and her husband frequently acts as chauffeur. He also carries out the lion's share of the domestic chores. When Good Morning Britain's Susanna Reid remarked on the immaculate condition of the couple's detached house last month, Sturgeon, 44, said: 'That's because I had my husband up most of last night cleaning.' Scotland's most powerful politician also leaves the cooking to her spouse, stating: 'I don't cook. I have had lots of disasters and now I prefer not to try, but Peter is a good cook and enjoys it.' However, anyone assuming that Murrell's only role is that of dutiful house-husband would be sorely mistaken. As chief executive of the SNP, he has transformed its fortunes, creating a formidable electoral machine. Transition: Murrell (right) is the man credited with transforming the nationalist leader (left) from surly apparatchik to national stateswoman – on the brink of holding the balance of power . Portrait: Instead of being offended, Ms Sturgeon (pictured) is 'tickled' by the image depicting her as a dominatrix . In 2001, when he took on the role, the party had a paltry 6,000 members; today the SNP is the third-biggest party in the UK, with a membership of 110,000. Murrell, who earns about £120,000 a year, and his wife first met when Ms Sturgeon – an 18-year-old firebrand Left-winger – attended an SNP gathering which he helped to organise. They were married in 2010 with a wedding cake created by the Scottish confectionery dynasty Tunnock's. So was Glasgow-based French artist Laetitia Guilbaud making her own comment on the Sturgeon-Murrell relationship when she dreamt up Naughty Nicola in 2009? 'No, not at all,' Ms Guilbaud, 35 told The Mail on Sunday. 'At the time she was very prominent, but I knew nothing about her partner. 'Her image was quite mousey and she often wore a red suit, so I just wanted to explore her sexy side.' Mr Murrell certainly liked what he saw and snapped up the work for £1,500. He said: 'Nicola was tickled by the depiction.' Perhaps he was following orders from the Chief Whip.

Summary 1: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, appreciates a provocative portrait, 'Naughty Nicola', gifted by her husband, Peter Murrell, and displayed in their Glasgow home. Murrell, earning £120,000 as the SNP's chief executive, has grown its membership to 110,000. Sturgeon, known for her red suit, leaves domestic chores to Murrell due to her cooking disasters. Their wedding cake was made by Tunnock's.

Summary 2: This article discusses a unique portrait of Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, titled 'Naughty Nicola', which portrays her as a dominatrix. The painting, which is believed to be hanging in her Glasgow home, was a birthday gift from her husband, Peter Murrell. Despite the provocative depiction, Sturgeon is said to be amused by the artwork. Murrell is credited with transforming Sturgeon's image from a stern bureaucrat to a national stateswoman.

Summary 3: Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, is amused by a provocative portrait titled 'Naughty Nicola', gifted by her husband, Peter Murrell, and displayed in their Glasgow home. Murrell, also the chief executive of the Scottish National Party (SNP), is credited with transforming Sturgeon's image and the party's fortunes. Their relationship dynamics, with Murrell handling domestic chores and Sturgeon's public image, are also discussed.

Summary 4: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, enjoys a provocative portrait titled 'Naughty Nicola', displayed in her Glasgow home, a gift from her husband, Peter Murrell. Murrell, the SNP's chief executive, has transformed the party, increasing its membership from 6,000 to 110,000, and earns £120,000 annually. Despite her political success, Sturgeon admits to cooking disasters, leaving domestic chores to Murrell.

A father-of-five has been stabbed to death at a Wisconsin river following an argument with three other fishermen. Peter Kelly, a 34-year-old volunteer high school wrestling coach, was stabbed in the chest beside the St Croix River at 9.45pm on Tuesday as he fished with a friend. The two men were on the Minnesota side of the river when they heard three men being loud and rude on the Wisconsin side and asked them to quieten down, authorities said. For the next three hours, Kelly and his friend exchanged heated words with the three other anglers. Scroll down for video . Loss: Peter Kelly, 34, was stabbed in the chest after he and a friend asked a group of rowdy fishermen to be quiet at a river on Tuesday. The argument escalated and Kelly was attacked and died at the scene . 'The group on the Minnesota side was making statements like, 'Why don't you clean up your act',' . Captain Steve Smith with the Polk County Sheriff's Office in Wisconsin told CBS Minnesota. 'The challenge was made – 'why don't you come over here?'' Kelly and his friend drove to Interstate Park on the Wisconsin side, where the argument escalated and one of the men pulled out a knife and stabbed Kelly in the chest. He died at the scene. After the stabbing, the attackers fled the scene and authorities are still searching for them. The Polk County Sheriff's Office said the three men are believed to be in their late teens or early 20s and were with a dog named Gunnar, who was either a golden retriever or a yellow lab. They were traveling in two vehicles with Minnesota license plates: a blue Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck and a small passenger car. Left behind: Kelly and his wife Christie, pictured, have four sons and a daughter all under the age of nine . Authorities are also asking for help tracking down five people who were in the area at about 7.30pm as they have witnessed the argument that ultimately escalated. Now his small community in St Croix Falls, which has just 2,100 people, is mourning the loss of the family man who volunteered as a coach at the high school's football, baseball and wrestling teams. He would often go to work at 4am so he could get back in time to coach before dinner, fellow high school coach Dan Clark told the Star Tribune. His day job was at Andersen Windows in Bayport, where he worked in quality control. 'He worked 10 to 12 hours a day at Andersen Windows, and he would come home and volunteer four hours a night to our wrestling program for four or five months a year,' Clark toldFox9. 'He was one of the greatest human beings that I ever hoped to meet.' His wife, Christie, stayed at home to care for their children, who are all under nine. They have four boys, Kellen, Payton, Miles and August, and last year welcomed a baby girl, Molly. Devastated: His brother, Mike Kelly, said the man's children did not understand what had happened . Confrontation: Kelly and a friend were on the Minnesota side of the St Croix River, pictured, and told men on the Wisconsin side to stop making so much noise. Kelly was stabbed at Interstate Park . 'I don't think they fully understand the implications of what happened,' his brother, Mike Kelly, told KARE. 'His daughter will never even get to know him.' Friends and family added that they do not believe Kelly was to blame for the confrontation. 'He did good things, and did what was right all the time,' his brother added. 'And that's probably what cost him. Some knuckle heads swearing and being silly.' Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the Sheriff's Office at 715-485-8300. A GoFundMe page has also been set up for the family.

Summary 1: Peter Kelly, a father of five, volunteer wrestling coach, and Andersen Windows employee, was fatally stabbed in the chest at a Wisconsin river after confronting three rude fishermen. The incident began in Minnesota and ended tragically in Wisconsin. The attackers fled, leaving the community mourning and authorities searching for the three men.

An author has claimed that 'people are ready' for his forthcoming play which stars impressionist Alistair McGowan as the disgraced paedophile Jimmy Savile. Journalist Jonathan Maitland said while there had been some shock at the drama, An Audience with Jimmy Savile, the majority of critics are eager to know when they will be able to see it. It will open in London in June, less than three years since the late comedian's depraved behaviour was exposed in a television documentary. Scroll down for video . The author of a play which sees impressionist Alistair McGowan portray Jimmy Savile has said the public is ready for it to be shown . The revelation that Savile had abused dozens of children and young women in hospitals and schools throughout the 70s and 80s sparked an enormous Scotland Yard probe into other alleged abuse. Although some lines of inquiry are still ongoing, Maitland claims now is an appropriate time to thrust the subject into the arts. In an interview with The Guardian he said: 'It has changed everything; it has changed the way we look at abuse, it has changed the way we prosecute it, it has changed attitudes towards it, the way we treat the survivors of it. 'What person would not want to explore what kicked it off?' Drawing on interview transcripts and statements provided to the police by some of Savile's many victims, the play's central role has been given to impressionist Alistair McGowan. Most often recognised for his comedic performances, Maitland said his leading actor is also 'terrific' at embodying the 'dark, nasty' elements of the story. In his popular BBC series, The Big Impression, McGowan included Savile in a bizarre comedy sketch in which he portrayed American rapper Eminem. McGowan previously portrayed the comedian in his popular series The Big Impression. In a sketch he responds to a teenage Eminem's repeated requests to appear on Jim'll Fix It . Twitter users rejected Maitland's claim the public was 'ready' for the play, describing the subject choice as 'unbelievable' Dressed in a blue and white tracksuit similar to those worn by Savile, McGowan writes to the Jim'll Fix It host to ask whether he could appear on the programme with his mother to whom he is violent. Later he impersonates Savile himself, responding: 'It would be hard to let you hurt your mum on the TV, especially at tea time.' Sinisterly, he then tells the fictional teenage Eminem that the pair could go to Alton Towers 'in a few hours' before giggling and licking his lips. Author Jonathan Maitland said people were 'ready' for the play to be shown less than three years after the abuse was exposed . Before opening to the public the play will hear findings of the Dame Janet Smith's inquiry into abuse at the BBC. While Maitland said he will be happy to adjust any contentious parts to its liking, he is confident the public, and Savile's victims, will be prepared for the drama. 'Yes it will be strange to see someone doing him for the first time, but I think people are ready.' Critics have however slammed his 'unbelievable' subject choice. One Twitter user said it was 'not quite right' to portray the scandal, while another commented: 'Why not make Fritzl the musical?', referring to the Austrian predator Josef Fritzl who imprisoned his daughter for 24 years to carry out horrific sexual abuse. John Caswell refuted Maitland's claim that the public were ready, responding: 'It's official, I am not people'. But a lawyer acting on behalf of 178 of the comedian's victims said she had met with the playwright and was satisfied the play had been produced in good taste. 'From what Jonathan has told me it will be extremely sensitive and will not in anyway undermine the seriousness of the subject ,' said Liz Dux, specialist abuse lawyer at Slater & Gordon. 'After meeting with him and discussing the project at length , I'm satisfied he will not cause offence to any of the victims . In fact some have agreed to meet with him.' An Audience with Jimmy Savile is the author's second play. His first, Dead Sheep, is being shown at the Park Theatre. Depraved: The comedian abused dozens of children and young women in hospitals, schools and television studios in the 1970s and 80s .

Summary 1: Jonathan Maitland's 'An Audience with Jimmy Savile', featuring Alistair McGowan, delves into Savile's abuse scandal, informed by Dame Janet Smith's BBC inquiry. Despite Twitter users' criticism, Maitland believes the public is ready. Liz Dux, a lawyer for Savile's victims, supports the play's sensitivity. Maitland's first play, 'Dead Sheep', is currently showing at the Park Theatre.

Summary 2: Maitland's 'An Audience with Jimmy Savile', starring McGowan, explores Savile's abuse scandal, drawing from the BBC inquiry. Despite Twitter backlash, Maitland and victims' lawyer Liz Dux affirm the public's readiness. McGowan, known for 'The Big Impression', embodies Savile. Maitland's 'Dead Sheep' is playing at Park Theatre.

Summary 3: Jonathan Maitland's play, 'An Audience with Jimmy Savile', starring Alistair McGowan, is set to open in London. The play explores the scandal of Jimmy Savile's abuse, revealed less than three years ago. Prior to its opening, the play will consider findings from Dame Janet Smith's inquiry into abuse at the BBC. Despite criticism, Maitland asserts the public is prepared for this drama.

Summary 4: This article discusses a play written by Jonathan Maitland, titled 'An Audience with Jimmy Savile'. The play, which is set to open in London in June, features impressionist Alistair McGowan in the lead role, portraying the disgraced paedophile Jimmy Savile.

Renowned fashion designer Collette Dinnigan has placed her luxurious Paddington home on the market after splashing out on a stylish waterfront home in one of Sydney's most exclusive suburbs. The four-bedroom 19th century sandstone property cost Dinnigan $4.45 million back in 2009, and is set to go under the hammer on May 23. After purchasing a lavish $6.5 million Watsons Bay property just last month with husband Bradley Cocks, Dinnigan is hoping for a cool $6 million when the lavishly renovated Paddington house sells. Scroll down for video . Fashion queen Collette Dinnigan has put her four-bedroom 19th century sandstone property on the market . The two-storey terrace home was built in 1880, and is set on 379 square metres of prime Paddington real estate. 'It's one of the oldest houses in Paddington, and the renovations are just stunning,' said selling agent Ben Collier for MsGrath Estate Agents, who is selling the property along with Will Manning at Ballard property. The international designer and her husband carefully renovated the property to be 'very sympathetic and in keeping with the period style, while still keeping it contemporary', said Mr Collier. Mr Collier said that the owners loved the combination of the house's proximity to restaurants and cafes, along with the unusually large terrace which makes the property an actual house. 'Most terraces in the area are around six metres, but the property's terrace is about twice that,' he said. Set back from the street in the exclusive suburb, the couple share their meticulously crafted home with children 10-year-old Estella and three-year-old Hunter.

Dinnigan has been a successful designer since opening her first store  in 1992 and sells her brand in New York, London and Hong Kong . The inspired reinvention of contemporary and period style offers a selection of casual and formal living areas, which extend onto a central courtyard area with stone finish and a leafy courtyard area. The French provincial style kitchen boasts a marble island bar, which flows effortlessly onto the outdoor entertaining area. The recently configured lower level master suite features a stand alone marble bathtub. 'The fact that the master bedroom is on the ground floor is unusual, and means that the owners can live completely on one level, as the guest bedroom and bathroom is upstairs,' said Mr Collier. 'It's a wonderful property for those who want the Paddington lifestyle but don't want to incorporate multiple levels,' he said. The bedrooms are a generous size, and have built ins, surrounded by a neutral colour scheme. The exposed sandstone walls and recycled wooden floorboards add to the feeling of rustic luxury.

Four genuine European heavyweights remain in the Champions League, a quartet steeped in history and silverware. Between Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Juventus, the big-eared trophy has been lifted 21 times. Any of those clubs would be deserving finalists in the Olympiastadion in Berlin on June 6. But for tension, intrigue, and the potential for high drama, the match-up that most appeals has to be Real Madrid versus Barcelona. Javier Hernandez's late winner against Atletico Madrid sent Real Madrid into the Champions League semis . Neymar scored both goals in the second leg as Barcelona beat Paris Saint-Germain 5-1 on aggregate . Transporting El Clasico to east Germany would bring a defining chapter to a myriad narratives, raising Europe’s grandest derby to a level not seen amid years of ebb and flow between the two Spanish behemoths. We have seen plenty of tangles in recent years, notably the Champions League semi-final of 2011, and some may insist the unseemly battles when the pair faced off 12 times in 19 months a couple of years ago became too much. But never have they duelled in the continent's largest match. That would crystalise their competition. It would be a fascinating game. Cristiano Ronaldo is looking for his third Champions League trophy and second in a row with Real . Barcelona's formidable front three of Luis Suarez (left), Neymar (centre) and Lionel Messi (right) They have only met twice this season, both times in La Liga. Real Madrid won 3-1 at the Bernabeu before Christmas before Barcelona's 2-1 win at the Nou Camp last month, so the appetite is not sated this campaign. A deciding third bout at Europe’s main event would draw global crowds not witnessed before. Just think: Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, the pre-eminent practitioners of this era, head-to-head for the biggest club prize of all. The Preener v the Peruser, Portugal’s athletic might against Argentina’s diminutive delight, the current Ballon d’Or holder against the man who won four consecutively. Barcelona won 3-1 on aggregate when the sides met in the semi-finals of the 2011 Champions League . Gareth Bale scored the winner when Real Madrid beat Barcelona in the 2014 Spanish Cup final . Bale celebrates at the Mestalla after scoring a wonder goal that won the Spanish Cup for Barcelona . Pep Guardiola could come up against his former team Barcelona after guiding Bayern into the last four . Then there's the undercard fights for supremacy: Gareth Bale, the world’s most expensive signing on paper, vying with Neymar, the game’s costliest player when all told; Karim Benzema, that deadly Frenchman, versus Luis Suarez, the indefatigable Uruguayan (both tied on six Champions League goals this season, by the way). Both teams have a trident attack to strike fear into their opponents. Whose will triumph on the biggest stage? It is an intriguing question to pose. Then we have Carlo Ancelotti trying to save his job by going for his fourth European Cup as a manager, against Luis Enrique, who has weathered a storm in his debut season to break the record for number of club wins (42) in a head coach's first 50 games. As a player he won La Liga with both Real and Barca but never the Champions League. Messi and Ronaldo have had many duels, and could have another one this season in the Champions League . Pepe heads home during Real Madrid's 3-1 win over Barcelona in the Clasico at the Bernabeu in October . Suarez scored what proved to be the winner when Barcelona won the La Liga meeting in March . Pep Guardiola facing his old club, the place he delivered dream football and two European Cups, would be tantalising – be we can have that in the semi-final. He needs to visit the Nou Camp as an opposition manager. That would leave Real vs Juventus in the other last-four match. Two teams with plenty of shared history, not least the 1998 Champions League final when the Italian side’s Zinedine Zidane, now a Real coach, was denied by Predrag Mijatovic’s goal. Yes, Real vs Barca on a June evening in Berlin would capture imaginations and invite the world to watch. Mar 22, 2015 - La Liga, Barcelona 2-1 Real Madrid . Oct 25, 2014 - La Liga, Real Madrid 3-1 Barcelona . Apr 16, 2014 - Spanish Cup, Barcelona 1-2 Real Madrid . Mar 23, 2014 - La Liga, Real Madrid 3-4 Barcelona .

The finish might have been uncharacteristically scruffy, scored after his first shot came back off the keeper, but it was a landmark goal for Lionel Messi at the Nou Camp on Saturday as he made it 400 goals for Barcelona in a 2-0 win over Valencia. Messi scored with the last kick and Luis Suarez scored with practically his first, putting Barcelona 1-0 up after just 56 seconds. Between the two strikes Claudio Bravo saved a Dani Parejo penalty as Valencia dominated the first half but they couldn't make their pressure tell. For Messi, still only 27, it was another milestone. 'I hope to score many more,' he wrote on his Facebook page. Lionel Messi (left), Luis Suarez (centre) and Neymar celebrate Suarez's goal in the first minute for Barcelona against Valencia . Suarez (left) lashed the ball in after neat play from Messi to continue his fine form for Barcelona . Valencia enjoyed a better first half, despite the scoreline and captain Dani Parejo missed a penalty in the ninth minute . Bravo celebrates his penalty save but Barcelona were fortunate to take a lead into half time . Messi tapped in Barcelona's second goal in stoppage time to seal the victory over Valencia . The Argentine has reached the 400 goal total in just 471 games with 309 goals in the league, 75 in the Champions League and 32 in the Copa del Rey. Goals in the World Club Cup and the Spanish and European Super Cup have also made up the stratospheric total. He also has 141 assists to his name in those 471 matches. Afterwards Luis Enrique said: ‘Messi gave us what he always gives us. But it’s not just about him it’s about the whole forward line and the whole team.’ Suarez was once again decisive after his two goals in midweek against PSG in the Champions League and he is now just six games from picking up a league winners medal in his first season. The early strike would have counted for nothing however if Valencia had made their first-half domination pay and had Bravo not stopped that eighth-minute penalty. As Messi raced from inside his own half to get the late late second, Enrique could be seen jumping up and down in the technical area long before the ball was in the back of the net. He knows what a major hurdle his side have now cleared. The victory sees Luis Enrique's side move five points away from Real Madrid, who take on Malaga later on Saturday . Messi skips past two Valencia challenges as Barcelona secured an important win against La Liga's fourth placed side . Messi attempts an acrobatic kick for Barcelona against Valencia in the La Liga encounter at the Nou Camp on Saturday . Barcelona were ahead inside the first minute with a move that swept from one end of the pitch to the other starting with Bravo releasing the ball quickly and finishing with a first time finish from Suarez past Diego Alves into far corner. Between the two Barca moved the ball quickly with Sergi Busquets releasing Messi and his pass poked home by the Uruguayan who has now scored 12 goals in his last 12 games. Far from being shell-shocked by the early set-back Valencia unleashed the big guns and Barcelona were under-fire for the rest of the first half. Paco Alcacer and Rodrigo both went close and were running an out-of-sorts Gerard Pique ragged. On eight minutes Valencia should have equalized. Rodrigo went down easily under a half challenge from Pique. It was a generous spot-kick and Bravo got down well to Parejo’s kick to save it. With a full Camp Nou sensing that a win here would be a huge step towards the title for Barcelona, and Valencia in a scrap of their own to finish in the top four the game was being played at cup final pace. Parejo flattened Busquets who for once he didn't need to exaggerate the fall as he crashed to ground. And full-back Orban risked a first half sending off with foul after foul. He was shown a yellow and never appeared for the second period. Adding to the drama was the panic in Barcelona’s defence. Pique was either failing to stay on his feet or giving the ball to Valencia forwards. The falling down was contagious with Adriano – another who didn’t come out for the second half – also losing his footing despite the perfect playing conditions. Neymar (right) attempts a diving header for Barcelona as his side looked to increase their lead at the top of La Liga . Barcelona have a five-point lead over Madrid, who could cut the deficit to two points with victory over Malaga . Alcacer continued to threaten. It’s not difficult to see why on-loan Manchester City forward Alvaro Negredo, who Valencia are obliged to buy this summer, cannot get a game at the moment. It is also why many Spain supporters think Diego Costa should not be Vicente Del Bosque’s first choice. Alcacer led the line and with Sofiane Feghouli and Rodrigo buzzing around him. Valencia gave Barcelona more problems than any visiting side at the Nou Camp this season. Alcacer came the closest in what remained of the first half making room for a shot from the edge of the area and hitting the base of Bravo’s post but Barca remained a threat on the break. In their best move Messi and Suarez linked with Neymar who pulled the ball back to Xavi instead of finishing. The midfielder set-up Messi and his shot flashed wide. Games at the Nou Camp can be like bull fights that used to be held in Catalonia before they were banned. Everyone in the arena knows the bull loses, it’s just a matter of when. But Valencia had worn the horns in the first half and Barcelona were relieved to get down the tunnel at half time still in one piece and still 1-0 up. The second half brought more calm to a Barcelona defence that now had Mascherano back alongside Pique after his first half spent in midfield. Valencia carried less threat and Barca went close with Neymar heading wide and Messi hitting the bar with a free-kick. He won a the kick with a brilliant run away from Parejo who up-ended him and his effort beat Diego Alves but not the frame of the goal. With 25 minutes left he moved to centre-forward as Suarez was taken off. There was no Neymar style sulk as he made his way off to a thunderous reception from the home fans. He goes into Tuesday’s game against PSG looking for his 20th goal of what has been an excellent first season. Negredo replaced Alcacer and immediately Valencia had their best chance of the second half with Bravo palming away Rodrigo’s shot. But there was to be no reward for all their fire and invention and when Messi raced clear to score the second with the last kick of the game it was all over in every sense.

Summary 1: In Barcelona's 2-0 victory over Valencia, Lionel Messi scored his 400th goal, Luis Suarez also netted, and Claudio Bravo saved a Dani Parejo penalty. Coach Luis Enrique praised the team's performance. The win moved Barcelona closer to a league winners medal and five points ahead of Real Madrid.

Summary 2: Lionel Messi's 400th goal and Luis Suarez's score led Barcelona to a 2-0 win over Valencia, with Claudio Bravo saving a penalty. Coach Luis Enrique, Neymar, and Sergi Busquets contributed to the victory, moving Barcelona closer to a league winners medal and ahead of Real Madrid, despite Gerard Pique's struggles.

Summary 3: Lionel Messi's 400th goal for Barcelona, scored in a 2-0 victory over Valencia, was a key highlight. Luis Suarez also scored, while Claudio Bravo saved a penalty from Dani Parejo. Messi's landmark goal and Suarez's contribution led to Barcelona's win.

Summary 4: This article discusses the recent achievement of Lionel Messi, a renowned footballer, who scored his 400th goal for Barcelona during a match against Valencia. The match ended in a 2-0 victory for Barcelona. Messi's landmark goal was a significant highlight of the game.

Former paramedic Crsity Collins had admitted that she used ice while driving and treating patients in an effort to raise awareness about the damaging drug . A former ice addict, who worked as a paramedic while high on the drug, has made her story public in an attempt to raise awareness of the illegal substance and the lack of support available for its victims. Crsity Collins was using crystal meth every day and spending up to $500 a week to keep up her drug habit. The 30-year-old, who took herself to the emergency room six times while suffering drug induced psychosis, has slammed health services for failing to offer her support despite claiming on numerous occasions that bugs were eating her eyes. 'Because I was awake all the time I had a staph infection, but I actually believed I might have bugs in my eyes and when I went to hospital, I was having drug-induced psychosis, I would say I had mites in my eyes or fleas or bugs, ' Ms Collins told Daily Mail Australia. 'Not once was I ever asked "are you on meth or taking drugs or are you having a drug induced psychosis" or "should we get a social worker or a psych assessment". 'I don't know if they were trying to protect me because I was in the ambulance service, but either way they shouldn't have been protecting me because firstly, I was dealing with people and patients and secondly, like anyone else I deserve the best treatment and care. 'I should have never been allowed to be released so many times without a psych consultation or councillor.' The 30-year-old said she was never offered support despite checking herself into the emergency room on six occasions (right) while claiming that she had bugs in her eyes (left) 'I should have never been allowed to be released so many times without a psych consultation or councillor,' she said . Ms Collins, whose addiction was fuelled by her post traumatic stress disorder and a borderline personality disorder, first began using illegal drugs recreationally, and first tried meth, while living in Darwin. However her habit ironically escalated when she attempted to escape the city an its 'party scene' by moving back to Launceston in Tasmania, where she rekindled a relationship with an ex-boyfriend who was part of 'the same sort of scene'. 'I didn't have any friends that weren't using drugs. Everyone had it around. Pills weren't easy to come across in Launceston, it was always speed and then ice took over,' Ms Collins said. 'It made me feel like superwoman - I could do anything and run on barely any sleep, so it became something I was using on a very frequent basis. 'You could be on top of everything even while lacking sleep - long night shifts, day shifts, I could study for hours when I came home, dinner would be done, the house would be clean - and it became a way to cope with these mental illnesses that I didn't know I had.' Ms Collins has now been clean for nine months after seeking help from the Department of Veterans Affairs . She said that it was when she and her now ex-boyfriend broke up that she became a daily user of the drug, even when driving and treating patients as an ambulance worker, but that none of her colleagues appeared to notice. 'I never felt affected. I never had any close calls where I could have put someone in danger. I was always very good at my job, very on the ball with patient care, and that why I was never suspected,' Ms Collins said. 'When I look back, I find it absolutely disgraceful. I could have had psychosis at any stage or changed my awareness or sense of judgement - it's such an unpredictable drug. 'I'd hate to know that anyone I know was being taken care of by someone that is hungover or on any form of drug that would alter their sense of awareness, let alone ice. 'But it wasn't until I started taking lots of sick days because my eyes were flaring-up form being awake all the time that anyone noticed something was wrong, and even then it was like they were more worried that I wouldn't have any leave left rather than that my health was deteriorating.' Sores from obsessive picking: She said that traking the drug used to make her feel 'like superwoman' Ms Collins has now been clean for more than nine months after finding free help with the Department of Veterans Affairs, which she was directed to by pure chance after being arrested. 'I was on my way to a dealer's house and got pulled over. My car was raided and they found drugs and when then let me out on bail to appear at court, a police officer who was a reservist said "you need to get yourself together" and told me to see Veterans Affairs,' she said. Unlike at the single out-patient facility in Launceston, which was run by nurses and social workers but had no councillors, Ms Collins found intensive help that assessed the root of her drug addiction and uncovered her mental health problems. She now has effective strategies in place with her councillor to deal with her borderline personality disorder and anxiety, which used to lead her to take drugs as a coping mechanism, as well as the post-traumatic stress disorder she acquired while working in Iraq as a medic for six months. 'You could be on top of everything even while lacking sleep - long night shifts, day shifts, I could study for hours when I came home, dinner would be done, the house would be clean - and it became a way to cope with these mental illnesses that I didn't know I had,' Ms Collins said . 'I was partially stressed [while in Iraq] because I was the only female in that group, so I didn't want to make mistakes and I wanted to fit in with the men,' she said. 'Then there was the constant artillery and bombings we'd get in the compound… it didn't feel like it affected me there, but when I came back I would hear loud bands and instantly hide or duck for cover. I'd be constantly looking for bombs on the side of the roads, it was a habit there and when I got home I couldn't get out of it.' She is not living with her family who provide her with emotional and finical support after she left her job and isolated herself from damaging social groups, and is actively looking for her next line of work. Ms Collins wants to use her story to raise awareness about the 'epidemic of ice users' in Tasmania, where she said middle and higher class users were very common . 'In Tasmania there is becoming an epidemic of ice users and ice related crime, so if it can help even just a few people, then I'm more than happy to share my story,' she said. 'It's not just the lower socio-economic groups in society that we should concentrate on, it's happening everywhere - the drug doesn't discriminate and it's happening in the higher class and the middle classes. You need to have money to use it. 'There's no drug testing in people that we hold in high regards, like paramedics, police and firies - pilots have to have drug tests and paramedics should be made to have these tests too.'

Summary 1: Crsity Collins, a former paramedic, battled an ice addiction, spending $500 weekly on the drug. She used it while treating patients and driving, even experiencing drug-induced psychosis. Collins has publicly shared her story to highlight the dangers of ice and the lack of support for addicts. She eventually sought help from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Article:
Kolo Toure has warned Raheem Sterling that leaving Liverpool could see him end up on the scrapheap at a big club, similar to the way that Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair did at Manchester City. Sterling stunned Liverpool earlier this week, giving an interview confirming that he has turned down a new £100,000-a-week contract and admitting he is 'quite flattered' by interest from Arsenal. Chelsea and Manchester City are also keen on English football's hottest property. But Toure, who used to play for  City with Rodwell and Sinclair, has warned his Anfield team-mate a move to one of European football's heavyweights may not be everything he has dreamed of. Raheem Sterling has been warned about the dangers of leaving Liverpool by his team-mate Kolo Toure . Toure compared Sterling's situation with that of Jack Rodwell (left) and Scott Sinclair joining Manchester City . Toure (centre) says Liverpool is the best place for Sterling to stay and continue his development as a player . After starring in Everton's midfield and making his England debut, Jack Rodwell was being linked with every big club around. Sir Alex Ferguson was known to be an admirer but Rodwell was snapped up by Manchester City for £12million. Repeated injury problems and the presence of Yaya Toure, David Silva, Samir Nasri and Javi Garcia saw his appearances limited, while Fernandinho arrived for £30m the next summer. After just seven league starts in two years, Rodwell moved on to relegation-threatened Sunderland for £10m. It was a similar story for Scott Sinclair. After powering Swansea City's promotion to the Premier League and scoring eight times in the top flight, Chelsea youth product Sinclair moved to City for £8m. But he too struggled with the competition in City's squad and moved to West Bromwich Albion on loan last season. He found it hard to break into the team there and returned to City before heading out on loan again to Aston Villa in January where he has found some form. Rodwell joined City in a £12million deal in 2012, while Sinclair made the same move from Swansea City for an £8m fee later that summer. The English pair made just nine Barclays Premier League appearances between them across two seasons at the Etihad Stadium. Rodwell joined relegation-threatened Sunderland last summer to end his City nightmare while Sinclair is trying to rebuild his career at Aston Villa. Toure says Sterling could be making a similar mistake by leaving Anfield. 'Both Rodwell and Sinclair went to a club where there is big competition and didn't play,' Toure said. 'If Raheem left Liverpool he wouldn't be sure to start games. Make a mistake or don't score for two games and he will be on the bench. There is no messing at clubs like that.' Brendan Rodgers used his pre-match press conference ahead of Saturday's trip to Arsenal to reiterate that Sterling was not for sale, and Toure sees Liverpool as the perfect place for the 20-year-old to continue his development. 'I'm not surprised there's speculation because everybody would want to have a player like him,' he told the Liverpool ECHO. 'But he needs to stay here. Liverpool is a great place for him. Sterling stunned Liverpool this week, giving an interview confirming that he had turned down a new deal . The likes of Chelsea, City and Arsenal would have big competition in their squads for a place . 'This is definitely the best place for him to continue his development. At Liverpool, he's beginning to be one of the most important players. He's playing every week. 'If he went to another club there would be big challenges he would face. He wouldn't be the most important player.' Sportsmail revealed on Thursday that Chelsea had joined the race to sign England star Sterling, with the Premier League leaders wanting to be kept informed of any developments in his contract situation. Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are also monitoring the developments in his stand-off at Anfield. Rodwell made just seven Premier League starts for City during his two-year spell before leaving the club . The former Everton man now plays for relegation-threatened Sunderland after a tough time at City . Sinclair's spell was even more difficult, he made just two league starts for City before moving out on loan . Sinclair is on loan at Aston Villa as he looks to rebuild his reputation as a young England talent . Doubts over Arsenal’s ability to fund a move have seen their interest questioned, but they are confident they have the financial firepower to compete for him with the likes of Chelsea and City. Liverpool boss Rodgers said on Thursday: ‘He’s got two-and-a-half years to go on his deal and he’s not going anywhere in the summer. 'I cannot speak for the owners but I have a good idea of what they would do. I know them well enough and for me it would not happen. Liverpool are one of the superpowers of football and the owners have made it clear that money doesn’t come into it. If the club doesn’t want to sell, it won’t sell, it’s as simple as that. Money has never been the objective for the club. ‘Whatever player - Raheem or anybody - it would always be on the terms of the club. ‘He still has two-and-a- bit years left of his deal so it’s not something we’re overly concerned about. I’m confident that at the end of the season we’ll find the solution.’ Brendan Rodgers has said Sterling is going nowhere this summer despite the speculation over his future . Sinclair spent more time on the bench than the pitch at City, and Toure thinks it could be similar for Sterling .

Summary 1: Kolo Toure warns Raheem Sterling, who refused a £100,000-a-week Liverpool contract, against transferring to a bigger club like Arsenal or Chelsea, referencing Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair's Manchester City struggles. Despite interest, Brendan Rodgers insists Sterling isn't for sale, and Toure argues Liverpool is best for Sterling's career, unlike Rodwell's Sunderland or Sinclair's Aston Villa moves.

Summary 2: This article discusses the advice given by Kolo Toure to his Liverpool teammate, Raheem Sterling. Toure warns Sterling about the potential pitfalls of leaving Liverpool for a larger club, drawing parallels with the experiences of Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair at Manchester City. Sterling has recently turned down a new contract from Liverpool, sparking interest from other clubs. However, Toure believes that staying at Liverpool is the best choice for Sterling's career development.

Summary 3: Kolo Toure advises Raheem Sterling, who declined a £100,000-a-week contract renewal from Liverpool, against moving to a larger club, citing Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair's Manchester City difficulties. Sterling's decision has piqued Arsenal and Chelsea's interest, but Toure maintains that Liverpool is the optimal place for Sterling's career growth.

Summary 4: Kolo Toure cautions Liverpool's Raheem Sterling about the risks of transferring to a bigger club, using Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair's struggles at Manchester City as examples. Sterling, who recently rejected a new Liverpool contract, has attracted attention from other teams. Despite this, Toure insists that remaining at Liverpool would be most beneficial for Sterling's career progression.

A dog who was living in a shelter for the past five years has finally gone home to a loving family in New York state after his photo was shared on social media. Chester, a 6-year-old Pit Bull mix, had been housed at the North Fork Animal Welfare League on Long Island. The poor pooch had been living in New York state shelters since 2010 and it looked as though things were going to remain that way, until a picture that was shared online garnered sympathy from across the country. Scroll down for video . How could you say no? This is the picture that secured Chester a loving home . Long-time coming: Chester, a six-year-old pit bull, was found as a stray and had been living in shelters for the past five years . Welcome to the family: On Friday morning, Dana Dor, her husband Adi, and their boys, Aidan and Brandon, headed from their Lake Ronkonkoma home to meet Chester . The shelter, which is based in Riverhead on Long Island posted a picture on Thursday that was hard for dog-lovers to resist. It showed Chester with a sign around his neck. An image that was clearly designed to tug at the heartstrings of dog-lovers. 'Why doesn't anybody want me? I've been waiting 5 years. Everyone at the shelter tells me what a good boy I am. So why has no one adopted me? I promised to be good and love my new family. Please maybe you are my new family/ I sit and wait for you to come,' the message pleaded. The picture was shared more than 6,000 times and inquires about adopting Chester poured in from all over the world. 'It was crazy. I posted the original photo on the League's Facebook page and by later that day there were over 6000 shares,' NFAWL manager Gabby Stroup said. 'There were more phone calls then I can count; the phone just never stopped. People called from Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Michigan, Oregon, New Jersey Wisconsin, Nova Scotia, Australia and more — people were tearing up as they called.' Tugging at heartstrings: Staring with his sad puppy dog eyes into the camera, Chester sat with a paw draped over a sign which read: 'Why doesn't anybody want me? Saying goodbye: Saturday morning, volunteers came to the shelter to say good-bye to Chester, a longtime favorite among those who'd come regularly to walk him and give him belly rubs and kisses . Within a couple of days of the posting, Chester was adopted by a family with two sons from New York. They came to take him home on Saturday. 'A woman named Dana called me inquiring about him; a friend of hers from Michigan had shared Chester's picture on her page,' Ms Stroup said. 'Dana and I talked about Chester for a bit; she wanted to talk it over with her family.' On Friday morning, Dana Dor, her husband Adi, and their boys, Aidan and Brandon, headed from their Lake Ronkonkoma home  to meet Chester. 'They came and met him and it is just a perfect match,' Stroup said to Southold Local.com . 'It was by far the most amazing thing I have ever seen — the amount of people who shared and called or emailed was amazing. This was one of the happiest days,' Ms Stroup said. Yesterday morning, volunteers came to the shelter to say good-bye to Chester. After five years, he had become a longtime favorite among those who'd come regularly to walk him. So happy together: Dana Dor said the family lost two Yorkies, five years ago, the same amount of time that Chester has been waiting for his forever family. 'We think he was waiting for us,' Mrs Dor said . Part of the family: Adi Dor sets up a cage for Chester to sleep in at his new home . Settling in: Chester had found his perfect match in the Dor family and was soon taken for a new life at their Lake Ronkonkoma home . The Dors arrived and Chester seemed to like the family instantly, covering their faces with licks and kisses. 'We saw him and we felt connected. It was meant to be, ' Adi Dor said; his wife said her husband had tears in his eyes the first time he met Chester. Their two young boys were delighted with the new addition to their family. They had been asking for a dog for some time. Ms Stroup said it was all down to the power of Facebook and the pleading message that hung around Chester's neck. The shelter has received a lot of attention as a result of Chester's plight and intends to use it's Facebook page to help other long-term residents of the refuge find new homes. Puppy power: Using the power of social media the animal shelter took a picture of the poor pooch and posted it onto a Facebook page where it received 6,000 likes and Chester found a loving home .

Article:
Lord Tebbit has hit out at David Cameron for not being a ‘real man’ with ‘real depth of experience’. The former Tory party chairman said that unlike major figures such as Sir Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee or Aneurin Bevan, Mr Cameron had never had a ‘proper job’. Instead, he said the Prime Minister had done nothing except be a special adviser and working in PR for Carlton Television. Lord Tebbit, pictured, launched an astonishing attack on David Cameron claiming the PM has never had a proper job before entering politics unlike Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee or even Aneurin Bevan . Lord Tebbit, a former airline pilot, also criticised Mr Cameron’s tactics in playing up the threat of a Labour-SNP government, and even suggested Tory voters north of the border vote tactically for Labour. He told the BBC’s Newsnight: ‘I just cannot read Mr Cameron’s mind. It’s a foreign country to me. ‘Men like Churchill, Atlee, Bevan, were real men with real depths of experience. ‘They had not gone from school to university to being a special adviser to working in an advertising agency.’ He added: ‘He doesn’t have that hinterland of experience any more than Mr Miliband.’ Lord Tebbit also suggested that Mr Cameron’s campaign tactics were pushing people into the arms of the SNP and Ukip. Lord Tebbit accused Mr Cameron, pictured, of bungling the Scottish referendum and annoying English voters . ‘Having bungled the Scottish referendum, it seems pointless to just irritate Scots by shouting at them from Westminster,’ the former Cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher said. ‘The English are irritated into voting for Ukip, by being shouted at from Westminster – and the Scots are irritated similarly.’ Lord Tebbit also told The Guardian it was ‘logical’ for Scots to vote tactically for Labour in areas where Conservative candidates stand no chance. ‘From the Tories’ point of view we are not going to come home with a vast number of seats from Scotland,’ he said. ‘We know that. ‘So the choice is would we rather have a Scot Nat or Labour? I think, on balance, probably a Labour MP would be a more reasonable thing to have.’ Meanwhile Madonna was criticised by her gay fanbase yesterday for paying ‘unapologetic’ tribute to Margaret Thatcher – who brought in legislation to ban the ‘promotion’ of homosexuality. The 56-year-old singer posted an image of the Iron Lady on photo-sharing website Instagram along with the caption ‘Thank you Margaret Thatcher’ followed by ‘unapologetic’ and a reference to her latest album, Rebel Heart. But the post was hurriedly removed after her gay fans reminded her that Mrs Thatcher’s ‘anti-gay’ legislation was only overturned in 2003.

Summary 1: Lord Tebbit criticizes Cameron's lack of experience and tactics regarding the Labour-SNP government, Scottish referendum, and Ukip. He suggests tactical voting for Labour in Scotland and criticizes Cameron's handling of Thatcher's legacy. Meanwhile, Madonna faces backlash for her tribute to Thatcher.

Summary 2: This article discusses the views of Lord Tebbit, a former Tory party chairman, who has criticized Prime Minister David Cameron for his lack of experience. Tebbit argues that unlike other major political figures, Cameron has never held a 'proper job' before entering politics, having only worked as a special adviser and in PR for Carlton Television.

Summary 3: Lord Tebbit criticizes Prime Minister David Cameron's lack of 'real' experience, contrasting him with political figures like Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee, and Aneurin Bevan who had 'proper jobs' before politics. Tebbit, a former Tory chairman, argues Cameron's career, limited to special advising and PR work, lacks depth.

Summary 4: Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit criticizes David Cameron's lack of 'real' experience compared to figures like Churchill, Attlee, and Bevan. He also criticizes Cameron's tactics regarding the threat of a Labour-SNP government, the Scottish referendum, and the rise of Ukip, suggesting they lack strategic insight.

Article:
The collapse in Roberto Mancini's relationship with Manchester City was rooted in his dismay at the quality of English players signed by the club. When names like Scott Sinclair, Jack Rodwell and to a lesser extent Adam Johnson were signed, he could barely disguise his contempt, feeling none of them would help him take on Barcelona and Real Madrid in the Champions League. 'Ask Marwood,' he would spit out when asked about the club's transfer policy, referring to the club's then-football administrator Brian Marwood who was responsible at the time for buying players. Tottenham defender Danny Rose has been linked with a move to Manchester City . Mancini was sacked in 2013 and nearly two years on, Marwood has a new role at the academy with a Spaniard, Txiki Begiristain, in his old job with the title director of football. And yet the dilemma remains the same: How do City buy enough top English players to fulfil quotas for homegrown players without breaking FPP (financial fair play) regulations again? It won't be easy and could explain why City – who have slumped to fourth in the league – are being linked with less glamorous names like Danny Rose and Aaron Cresswell. Good players certainly, but good enough? Probably not. It's a sobering thought that Rodwell made only seven Premier League starts in two seasons for City after a £12million move from Everton. Sinclair started just twice after signing from Swansea and is currently on loan at Aston Villa. Plenty of things at City have been carefully planned and executed well since the club's owners from Abu Dhabi took over in 2008. (From left) Manchester City director of football Txiki Begiristain, assistant manager Brian Kidd, manager Manuel Pellegrini and former football administrator Brian Marwood . The Etihad Campus is a glittering monument to football development and helping the community, while two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and Capital One Cup is an excellent trophy haul considering where the club have come from. But one weakness has been in their approach to having enough homegrown players, lagging behind most of their rivals. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger signed Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers and Manchester United bought Wayne Rooney, Phil Jones and Luke Shaw as teenagers. Most spectacularly, Liverpool bought players like Jordan Henderson, Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling and invested in making them better. Spurs have brought through Harry Kane and Ryan Mason from their academy. Only Chelsea face similar issues to City. Homegrown rules are complicated and differ slightly between competitions. Scott Sinclair (left) and Jack Rodwell are two English players who were bought by Manchester City . In the Premier League, you must have eight homegrown players if you fill your squad of 25. Homegrown players can be born overseas as long as they have been at a club's academy three years before the age of 21. If clubs can't find eight, they have to reduce their squad accordingly, as Chelsea have had to this season. Under 21 players can be named in the squad in addition to the 25. City's six Premier League homegrown players are: Joe Hart, Richard Wright, Dedryck Boyata, Gael Clichy, Frank Lampard and James Milner and there lies a major problem for next season. Lampard is definitely off and Milner is out of contract too. Clichy has endured a poor season and City will want a new left-back while Boyata, a Belgian who has been at City since he was 16, is not good enough to win a regular first-team place. The feeling is he was only offered his latest contract because he filled one of the homegrown slots. Ditto, third-choice goalkeeper Wright. Manchester United signed both Wayne Rooney (left) and Luke Shaw as teenagers . The Champions League squads of 25 also require eight players to have been trained in England, but four of those must have come through the ranks at City. Boyata was their only club-trained player named this season. It will be a major problem for the club next season as their one-season punishment (for breaching FFP rules) to name a squad of 21 is lifted and they can name 25 again. These will be issues exercising the minds at the very top of the club. But whichever way they look at it, City have three options which carry a downside: . 1) Spend big on the best English players 2) Find their own from their academy or 3) Buy cheaper English players who might not be good enough. Daniel Sturridge (left) and Jordan Henderson are two players Liverpool bought to boost their English quota . For option one, supply and demand is a problem. There are probably only three England players most people would call good international-class and therefore worthy of a place in the City team should they want to win titles at home and abroad. Hart is already there, Wayne Rooney is at Manchester United and presumably unattainable while Raheem Sterling would be a premium price. 'Can you get Sterling? Maybe if you go to Liverpool with £100million you can,' complained Manuel Pellegrini recently. No wonder City appear ready to open negotiations at £50m. Kean Bryan is one of the young players at Manchester City who is tipped to go on to big things . Midfielder Kean Bryan ticks all the boxes for what Manchester City hope to achieve in the future. A box-to-box midfielder from Manchester, he joined City at the age of 11 and has gone on to be an England youth international at different age levels. Aged 18, he has played for Patrick Vieira's under-21 elite development squad this season, and played five matches in City's run to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Youth League, a Champions League equivalent for under-20s. Been compared to Steven Gerrard. The last Mancunian to play regularly for City was Michael Johnson and he had to retire early after injury problems. Of the next generation, £60m has been quoted for Everton's Ross Barkley, a huge price for unproven talent. Harry Kane would be an interesting target as would Everton's Under21 defender John Stones, who might represent the best value-for-money. Jack Wilshere has had injury problems. City's academy cost £200m but so far none has broken into the first-team squad regularly. Marcos Lopes is on loan at Lille and may move there permanently. Karim Rekik has played Champions League football for PSV. City will hope starlets like Jose Pozo, Thierry Ambrose, Mathias Bossaerts, Seko Fofana, Jason Denayer and Kean Bryan will become their homegrown first-teamers of the future, but they are unlikely to make a major contribution next season. Bryan is novel and interesting, he is from Manchester and has been likened to Steven Gerrard. Ross Barkley is one of the most hotly tipped players in England and worth in the region of £60m . The third option is to try and sign any English Premier League player who is available. It might not be the best idea for the players themselves, Johnson said after he was sold to Sunderland that the move to City can turn sour for young players. 'It is a lot different when you don't play. The novelty wears off, definitely,' he said. Rodwell is now at Sunderland too, while Sinclair will make his loan move to Aston Villa permanent provided they stay up. Rose and Cresswell be warned. Making up the numbers at Manchester City doesn't necessarily help the player or club. PREMIER LEAGUE . Eight players in the 25-man squads must be homegrown. A player counts as homegrown if they have spent three years at an English club up to the age of 21. Squads can be supplemented by as many Under 21 players as clubs want. CHAMPIONS LEAGUE . Eight of the 25-man squad must be homegrown, four of whom must be club-trained ie have come through the ranks of the actual club they are playing for. Squads can be supplemented by Under-21 players provided they have been with the club for at least two years. SERIE A . From 2016, squads will be limited to 25 players (not counting Under 21s), four of whom have to have grown up in Italy and four of whom have to be products of their club's academy, similar to Champions League rules. Clubs are not allowed to sign more than two non-EU players in a season. LA LIGA . Clubs are not allowed more than three non-EU players in their squads of 25, or in matches. However, after five years, you can apply for Spanish citizenship and become an EU player, as Lionel Messi has done. There are no additional homegrown rules for EU players. BUNDESLIGA . Clubs need to include eight homegrown players, including four from their own youth academy, in their squad. But unlike the Premier League, squads aren't restricted to 25 players so they can still sign as many non-homegrown players as they like. There are no restrictions on signing non-EU players. MANCHESTER CITY . Association-trained homegrown players: Joe Hart, Richard Wright, Gael Clichy, James Milner, Frank Lampard. Club-trained homegrown player: Dedryck Boyata .

Summary 1: This article discusses the strained relationship between Roberto Mancini, the former manager of Manchester City, and the club's administration. Mancini was reportedly dissatisfied with the quality of English players signed by the club, believing they were not of the caliber needed to compete with top European teams. The club's struggle to balance the need for homegrown talent with financial fair play regulations continues to be a challenge.

Summary 2: Roberto Mancini's dissatisfaction with Manchester City was rooted in the club's signing of English players like Scott Sinclair, Jack Rodwell, and Adam Johnson. Mancini felt these players were not capable of competing with top-tier European teams. The club's ongoing struggle to balance homegrown talent acquisition with financial fair play regulations remains a significant challenge.

Summary 3: Former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini was dissatisfied with the English players signed by then-football administrator Brian Marwood, including Scott Sinclair, Jack Rodwell, and Adam Johnson. The club, now overseen by Txiki Begiristain, continues to struggle with acquiring sufficient homegrown players like Danny Rose and Aaron Cresswell, while complying with financial fair play (FPP) regulations.

Summary 4: Roberto Mancini's strained relationship with Manchester City stemmed from his dissatisfaction with the English players signed by Brian Marwood, the club's then-football administrator.

Prosecutors have been accused of losing a Nissan Micra at the centre of a double murder case. Timothy Crook is alleged to have murdered his elderly parents Bob, 90, and Elsie, 83, and then driven their bodies 150 miles before dumping them. But the grey car he is accused of using to transport the bodies has been lost, Bristol Crown Court was told.

Timothy Crook (pictured) is alleged to have murdered his elderly parents Bob, 90, and Elsie, 83, and then driven their bodies 150 miles in a grey Nissan Micra . Sarah Jones, representing Crook, 50, said the blunder could have forensic consequences for his case. Crook is accused of killing his parents at their home in Swindon in July 2007 and then driving their bodies to Lincoln, where they used to live. Ms Jones told Judge Neil Ford QC at a preliminary hearing: 'The car in which the bodies were transported to Lincoln has been lost. 'That may have forensic consequences. We have some forensic angles being looked at. 'I have simply been told the Crown don't know where the car is. If it is not available it would be of help to have an identical model. 'It was a particular model which we believe did not allow for the laying down of the back seats.' Crook is accused of killing his parents (pictured) at their home in Swindon in July 2007 and then driving their bodies to Lincoln, where they used to live . Police said the car (similar to the one pictured) which Crook is said to have driven was not lost and was in the North of England . A spokeswoman for the CPS added: 'It's not us who lost the car. We don't investigate the case, we can't be in possession of the car.' Wiltshire Police said the car was not lost, but did not know where it was exactly. A spokesman said: 'The vehicle has not been lost, we understand it to be in the North of England. 'But I believe there was a conversation in court around whether or not it would need to be brought back for further forensics etc.' Crook appeared at the plea and case management hearing via video link from Rampton Hospital and spoke only to confirm his name and plead not guilty to the two murder charges. He is accused of murdering both parents between July 6 and 12, 2007. Some 49 witnesses are expected to be called at the trial which is provisionally set to open on July 6 and last up to four weeks.

Disabled children can face a lot of challenges - but one photographer from Washington wants to make sure they recognize that they all have a super-human ability to conquer any challenge set before them. For The Superhero Project, Renee Bergeron, 38, photographs children with special needs as superheroes, dressing them up with capes, goggles, and wands in order to make them feel like they can do anything. 'I think a lot of people look at others with special needs and think of them as "less" in some ways,' Mrs. Bergeron, who also has a parenting blog, recently told The Mighty. 'Let’s face it, though — these kids are all fighters. The obstacles they overcome daily just to cope in our world ought to make us all see them as superheroes.' Caped crusader: Avery, pictured, was photographed for Renee Bergeron's Superhero Project; Avery was born prematurely, has had multiple brain surgeries, and has a feeding tube in her stomach . Powerful shots: Mila, left, suffers from speech disorders, while Mordecai, right, was diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and has several missing fingers and toes . Mrs. Bergeron's first little superhero subject was her own son, Apollo, now four. Apollo was diagnosed with a rare heart defect when he was 18 months old and, in addition to undergoing several medical procedures and surgeries, had to be fitted with a feeding tube at a young age. Despite his health problems and the tube protruding from his stomach, when Apollo was two, Mrs. Bergeron said, he would pose for pictures with 'such strength and confidence'. His mother knew that one day Apollo might feel self-conscious about the tube, so she wanted to document him looking strong and proud, in the hopes that the images might inspire him to feel that way again later on in life. Proud princess: Victoria, pictured, was born with Congenital Femoral Deficiency, which affects her legs, hips, and knees . Super cute: Mrs. Bergeron's son Apollo, left, was her first subject; Melanie, right, is autistic, epileptic, and has Sensory Processing Disorder . After speaking to other moms of children with special needs on Facebook, Mrs. Bergeron decided to take similarly empowering photographs of more disabled children. In 2013, she began working on the The Superhero Project, taking pictures of children with physical disabilities, autism, and sensory disorders free of charge. After Apollo, she photographed Avery, a little girl born prematurely who underwent multiple brain surgeries, Melanie, a four-year-old with autism and epilepsy, and Cody, a red-headed boy with Down syndrome. Tough cookie: Mrs. Bergeron says she 'seriously fell in love with' Cody, pictured, who has Down syndrome, Sensory Processing Disorder, and Speech Apraxia . Watch out, bad guys: Avi, pictured, faces 'a variety of sensory and social challenges', but is still 'vivacious and full of life' 'My hope is that we can spread awareness about special needs, while giving encouragement to families through the gift of professional photography,' she explained on her website. She continued: 'While their special needs are what brought them to the shoot, I wanted the images to capture their individual spirits.' Mrs. Bergeron and her husband, Chuck, also have 13other children, nine of whom are biological and five of whom are adopted. Apollo, born in June 2010, is their youngest child.

Summary 1: Renee Bergeron's Superhero Project, inspired by her son Apollo's rare heart defect and feeding tube, photographs special needs children as superheroes. After connecting with other parents on Facebook, she expanded the project to include children with physical disabilities, autism, and sensory disorders, offering her services free of charge.

Summary 2: This article discusses the work of Renee Bergeron, a photographer from Washington who has initiated a project called The Superhero Project. The project involves photographing children with special needs dressed as superheroes. Bergeron's aim is to empower these children and help them recognize their ability to overcome any challenge.

Summary 3: Renee Bergeron's Superhero Project, inspired by her son Apollo's heart defect, photographs special needs children, like Avery, Melanie, and Cody, as superheroes. After connecting with parents on Facebook, she expanded the project to include children with physical disabilities, autism, and sensory disorders, offering her services free of charge.

Summary 4: Renee Bergeron's Superhero Project empowers special needs children by photographing them as superheroes. Her first subject was her son, Apollo, who was diagnosed with a rare heart defect and fitted with a feeding tube. Bergeron's goal is to help these children see their strength and ability to conquer challenges.

(CNN)It was like a scene out of "Make Way for Ducklings" on Tuesday on a rainy street in Washington. CNN Situation Room correspondent Brian Todd and photojournalist Khalil Abdallah were on their way to interview a legal analyst on L Street NW when they happened on a brood of baby ducks causing a stir. Abdallah reports the ducklings and their mom had crossed heavily trafficked street, and some restaurant patrons stopped on the sidewalk to corral them. A man gave up his umbrella for the cause "while the mom was going crazy." "One duckling tried to run back to the street but they caught it in time," Abdallah said. The mother duck followed the umbrella while pedestrians stopped cars on L street for them to safely cross the road. The Washington Post reports the pedestrians took the bird family to "a more enclosed grassy area" at 16th and L streets NW. (Yes, baby ducks warrant two national news stories.) "We thought it was an extraordinary situation," Todd said. "You see pigeons, you see squirrels, you see the occasional raccoon in the D.C. area, and ... you  see deer ... We've never seen anything like this in the middle of town."

Summary 1: CNN's Brian Todd and Khalil Abdallah, en route to interview a legal analyst on L Street NW, encountered baby ducks causing a commotion. Assisted by restaurant patrons and a man with an umbrella, they helped the ducks, led by the mother following the umbrella, cross a busy road. Pedestrians stopped cars for safe passage to a grassy area at 16th and L streets NW, an extraordinary event for the city.

A man appeared in court today charged with the murder of Syrian preacher Abdul Hadi Arwani, who was found dead in his car in Wembley last week. The Crown Prosecution Service announced today that 36-year-old Leslie Cooper would be charged over the suspected murder of Mr Arwani, 48, who was an outspoken opponent of the Assad regime in his native country. He appeared before magistrates in Camberwell today for a brief hearing, and will appear at the Old Bailey later this week . Meanwhile, Scotland Yard said tonight that a second man, aged 61, had been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder Mr Arwani. Charge: A man has been charged with the murder of Syrian imam Abdul Hadi Arwani . The imam ran a building company as well as preaching at various mosques before he was shot dead and his body abandoned in a Volkswagen Passat last Tuesday night. Cooper, from Brent in north-west London, was remanded in custody by a judge at Camberwell Magistrates' Court and ordered to appear at the Old Bailey within the next 48 hours. He wore a grey tracksuit during the minute-long hearing, and spoke only to confirm his name. Earlier, the CPS said in a statement: 'The Crown Prosecution Service has today authorised the Metropolitan Police to charge Leslie Cooper, 36, with the murder of Abdul Hadi Arwani. Mr Arwani was shot dead in the Greenhill area of London on April 7, 2015. Mosque: Mr Arwani was a preacher at the An Noor mosque and cultural centre in west London . Car: He was found dead in his black Volkswagen Passat in Wembley last Tuesday night . 'Mr Cooper now stands charged with a criminal offence and has the right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.' The family of Mr Arwani have thanked the community ‘for the outpouring of support during this extremely difficult time’. In a statement, released through Scotland Yard, Mr Arwani's son Murhaf said: ‘We are touched to learn how many people my father helped, advised and inspired in his short life.’ Mr Arwani also urged anyone who may be able to help with the investigation to come forward. He said: ‘If anyone has any additional information that can help with the investigation, we urge you to please come forward and speak to the Metropolitan Police. ‘Your co-operation will help us close this painful page and begin to move on with our lives, in the knowledge that the person who took away our father will be brought to justice and duly punished for this heinous crime.’ A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'Leslie Cooper, 36, of Brent, NW10 was charged on Tuesday, April 14 with the murder of Mr Arwani and has been remanded in custody to appear at Camberwell Green Magistrates' Court at 14:00hrs this afternoon.' A post-mortem examination found that Mr Arwani, a father of six, died from gunshot wounds and counter-terrorism officers were tasked with investigating his murder. He was an imam at the An Noor mosque in Acton, west London, from 2005 to 2011, but left the institution after being embroiled in a row with other leading figures there. Mr Arwani was a passionate opponent of Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime, and supported the opposition seeking to unseat the dictator. He was apparently forced to flee his home country after he was caught taking photographs in the town of Hama, which was devastated by a government massacre in 1982. After he was found dead, Mr Arwani's family paid tribute to him calling him 'the most peaceful man you could wish to meet', and called on members of the public to help find his killer. An Noor has been linked with extremism after a number of radical preachers were invited to speak there, but friends of Mr Arwani have insisted that he held moderate and pro-Western views. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Summary 1: This article discusses the court appearance of a man named Leslie Cooper, who has been charged with the murder of Abdul Hadi Arwani, a Syrian preacher.

New York (CNN)New York state authorities have issued a health alert following a dramatic spike in hospital visits for synthetic marijuana-related emergencies. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday that more than 160 patients in nine days have been rushed to hospitals across the state for adverse reactions to synthetic cannabinoid, known as "spice" or "K2." "Spice" and other similar synthetic drugs are often marketed as legal plant material coated with chemicals that are supposed to mimic the effects of marijuana, according to a statement from the governor's office. "Since the exact compounds contained in synthetic cannabinoid products change so frequently, it's often impossible for users to know exactly what they are putting in their body," acting New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said. Symptoms after use have a wide range of severity, from confusion, drowsiness and headaches to increased heart rate, seizures and loss of consciousness, according to the New York State Department of Health. Synthetic marijuana is popular among teens because it is marketed as incense or natural products to "mask its true purpose," the health department statement said. "Young people may be fooled into thinking that these substances are safe because they are sold over the counter or are in colorful packaging, but they are not made for human consumption," New York Alcohol and Substance Abuse Service s Commissioner Arlene Gonzalez Sanchez said. "They are dangerous and can have significant, long-term effects on the brain." The recent surge is not isolated in New York; other states across the country have noticed similar trends. Alabama Department of Public Health issued a statement last week acknowledging a rise of synthetic marijuana usage and said there had been 98 overdoses suspected to be linked with "spice" in the previous month. Mobile County alone has seen seven cases in 2015 so far, more than the entire previous year, the statement said. Mississippi health officials are also concerned that synthetic marijuana is on the rise. Ninety-seven  cases over an eight-day span in April were reported to the Mississippi Poison Control Center, a Department of Health press release said.

Summary 1: New York's Governor Cuomo, Dr. Zucker, and Arlene Gonzalez Sanchez warn of a surge in synthetic marijuana use, particularly among teens. Over 160 hospitalizations occurred in nine days due to 'spice' or 'K2'. Symptoms vary, and the compounds are often unknown. Similar trends and 98 overdoses were reported by Alabama's Department of Public Health, with Mobile County particularly affected.

Summary 2: New York's health alert, issued by state authorities including Governor Cuomo, warns of a surge in synthetic marijuana-related hospitalizations. Over 160 patients experienced adverse reactions to 'spice' or 'K2' in just nine days. Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker noted the unknown compounds in these products. The Department of Health lists symptoms ranging from confusion to seizures.

Summary 3: This article discusses a health alert issued by New York state authorities due to a significant increase in hospital visits related to synthetic marijuana emergencies.

Woods, who has confirmed he is ready to play at Augusta after spell working on his game, is one of only five players to win the Masters, The Open, the US PGA Championship and the US Open - and it's that success which led to a young McIlroy aiming to emulate him. Scroll down for video . A young Rory McIlroy is portrayed by an actor in the film as it charts his progress in the sport .

My first recollection of the Masters was 1986, when Jack won. 'I remember him making a putt at 17 and lifting that putter up. Fourteen years later at the 2000 PGA Championship, I got to play with and against him – someone I looked up to.' It remains to be seen whether Woods will be at the business end of the Masters come Sunday but McIlroy relishes playing with his idol. 'It's been an incredible journey for me, going from massive fan to competitor,' he added. 'To think that not too long ago I was that little boy watching him on TV to where I am now. 'It's been a cool journey and I'm very lucky I get to compete with and against him, because he inspired me as a kid and he inspires me now. He's the best player I've ever seen.'

A lawsuit filed by former Gossip Girl actress Kelly Rutherford attempting to have a judge order her kids to return to the U.S. from their father's custody in France has been dismissed once and for all. The case was dismissed with a court order stating that it did not have the jurisdiction to force the kids, son Hermes, 8, and daughter Helena, 5, to come back to the United States. Rutherford, 46, claims her children were illegally deported to France when a California Court awarded custody to her ex-husband Daniel Giersch, 40, and she pleaded for the order to be reversed. Scroll down for video . Kelly Rutherford, pictured with her children, Hermes and Helena, during a party in the Hamptons in August 2013, was shut down by the courts again in a final plea to gain custody of her children . Rutherford's lawsuit stating that her children were illegally deported from the United States was dismissed once and for all by a New York court . She claimed that no other U.S. court has ordered children to live in another country when they have an able parent in the United States. Giersch, who is a German citizen residing in France, was deported from the U.S. over allegations of visa fraud. But the dismissal of her case states that Rutherford failed to argue why the federal court should intervene in her custody dispute with Giersch. 'Petitioners allege that the California state court's custody order had the effect of deporting the children in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment right to remain in the United States,' the document reads. The document added: 'There is no authority establishing the unconditional right of minor children to reside in the United States when one of their custodial parents lives abroad. 'Likewise there is no "plainly defined and peremptory duty" requiring Respondents to interfere with the custody order - nor is there, as Petitioners contend, a general affirmative duty on federal agencies requiring them to intervene against what is claimed to be unconstitutional state action.' After divorcing in 2010, Rutherford and ex-husband Daniel Giersch went through a nasty custody battle which ended with Giersch being awarded custody while the children were to visit Rutherford on vacations . Kelly left Daniel Giersch in 2009 while she was pregnant with their second child after the German businessman's visa was revoked. A judge awarded him custody of the children in 2012 . Further, the court states 'the children have not been deported; they retain their United States citizenship and, once they reach the age of majority, they will be free to choose where to reside. 'There is, therefore, no non-frivolous constitutional question, only an attempt to seek federal judicial intervention in a state court custody dispute' The order affirmed the original order and said it would be improper for the federal court to intervene in Rutherford's custody battle. Because of this, there will be no intervention and the appeal will be dismissed. A California court ruled two years ago that the children should live in France with ex-husband Daniel Griesch, who she divorced in 2010 after four years of marriage. Rutherford has said that the court in Monaco, where Giersch lives, decided on a new custody order that lets her only see her children on holiday and during the summer. It has left Rutherford emotionally exhausted, desperate and having filed for bankruptcy with $2million in debt after spending all her earnings from Gossip Girl on legal fees and flights to France to see her children. In it's dismissal of her case, the court said it failed to argue why the federal court should intervene in the custody dispute . Daily Mail Online revealed in August that Rutherford had filed a lawsuit at the Federal Appeals Court of the Southern District of New York in Manhattan on behalf of herself and her children. She sued the U.S. government, including Attorney General Holder and Jeh Johnson, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, because she claims that an earlier ruling by a California Superior Court judge that her children should live in France was unlawful. Only federal courts can deal with matters of deportation. she argues. She wanted the US District Court in New York court to grant her ‘temporary emergency authority’ over her children and an order saying the previous ruling was ‘unconstitutional’. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security said on November 24 that Rutherford's case was nothing more than her being dissatisfied with the result of the child-custody proceeding. The departments demanded on that her appeal be dismissed and said she's forcing the departments to become part of something they were never involved in. Rutherford argued her case in a New York court on March 18, but the appeal court shut down her plea and ordered the original order to remain in place.

Summary 1: This article discusses the ongoing custody dispute between former Gossip Girl actress Kelly Rutherford and her ex-husband Daniel Giersch. Rutherford's lawsuit, which sought to have her children returned to the U.S. from France, was dismissed by a court stating it lacked jurisdiction. Rutherford claimed her children were illegally deported when a California court awarded custody to Giersch.

Summary 2: Kelly Rutherford's lawsuit, seeking to return her U.S. citizen children, aged 8 and 5, from France, was dismissed. The children live with their father, Daniel Giersch, a German citizen whose visa was revoked, leading to their 2010 divorce. Rutherford's limited visits and legal fees led to her bankruptcy.

Summary 3: Actress Kelly Rutherford's lawsuit to return her U.S. citizen children from France, where they live with their father, German citizen Daniel Giersch, was dismissed. The court cited lack of jurisdiction over the custody dispute, initiated when Giersch, facing visa fraud allegations, was awarded custody by a California court.

Defiant Nigel Farage today insisted he did not 'lose my rag' after rounding on the audience of a live TV debate for being too left wing. The Ukip leader was booed by voters at Westminster's Methodist Central Hall as he faced claims he blamed all of Britain's problems on migrants. Pollster ICM, which was hired by the BBC to select the audience members, today defended its process 'using random location selection techniques'. Nigel Farage today insisted he did not 'lose my rag' after rounding on the audience of a live TV debate for being too left wing . Mr Farage, pictured today, risked alienating those watching at Westminster's Central Hall in London as he protested they were 'a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC' The BBC stressed that the audience was carefully selected by an process, but Mr Farage said something had gone 'wrong' with the process. Asked whether he had lost his temper, Mr Farage told the BBC News Channel: 'I was very calm about it. I didn't lose my rag.' He said his protest had been sparked by the hostile audience reaction to his argument that high levels of immigration were increasing pressure on the housing market, something he said would be accepted by 'most rational people'. And he added: 'This is not the first time I've seen this. The night of the by-election that Douglas Carswell won in Clacton with a landslide, there was a Ukip representative - Patrick O'Flynn - on Question Time in Clacton and the audience were deeply hostile to him.' Asked if he blamed the BBC, Mr Farage said: 'Sometimes these things go wrong, sometimes you get groups who apply to be on programmes who perhaps aren't as truthful on their applications as they could be. 'In this case, the BBC gave the job to a polling company called ICM who are famous for getting everything about Ukip wrong and that I think was the mistake. 'Am I going to make a complaint? I've got an election to fight. What matters isn't the 200 people in the room, what really matters are the millions of people watching on television.' Mr Farage's outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching . Independent pollsters ICM were hired by the BBC to select the audience of around 250 people. After facing stiff criticism from Ukip, the firm today released a statement on how it chose the audience members. They were selected from a 20-mile radius of the venue in Westminster. The region was broken up into 30 small areas, and at least 8 people were chosen from each area. Each person was selected to reflect the 'composition of the UK population by gender, age, ethnicity, and social grade, and political protocols that reflected the balance as agreed between the broadcasters and the political parties', ICM said. A fifth of the people declared themselves to be 'undecided voters'. A 'small number' of SNP and Plaid Cymru supporters were brought in from Scotland and Wales. ICM added: 'The recruitment approach replicated those used by ICM at all the 2010 leader debates, both the Clegg vs Farage debates last year, and the recent ITV debate.' Mr Farage was widely considered to have won the debates against Nick Clegg last year, after which the Ukip leader made no complaint about the audience composition. Last night saw five opposition party leaders go head-to-head in a 90-minute live TV debate. Mr Farage appeared alongside Labour's Ed Miliband, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Green Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. During the earlier exchanges, the leaders on Mr Farage for his anti-immigration policies, attracting applause from the audience. Mr Farage was taken aback, and attacked a 'total lack of comprehension' from those watching and protested they were 'a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC'. His outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching. Mr Farage warned that foreigners arriving in the UK 'has directly contributed to the housing crisis'. But he came under fire for linking all of the countries problems to immigration. Green party leader Natalie Bennett took a swipe at Mr Farage: 'There is someone here on this platform who wants to totally demonise migrants and you know who I mean.' She hit back at claims migrants are causing a crisis in the health service: 'One in four doctors is foreign born, 40 per cent of NHS staff are foreign born. Mr Miliband said told Mr Farage: 'You abuse immigrants and those with HIV and then you complain that Ukip is being abused.' Miss Sturgeon won loud applause as she urged Mr Farage to 'put the bogeyman to one side'. She told him: 'We have a housing crisis across this country. You know what, Nigel Farage? It isn't caused by immigrants. In your world every problem is caused by immigrants.' But Mr Farage claimed the audience was biased against him: 'There just seems to be a total lack of comprehension on this panel, and indeed amongst this audience, which is a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC.' Mr Farage was heckled by members of the audience before David Dimbleby, who was presenting the broadcast on BBC1, intervened to say: 'Nigel, let me just say one thing. 'This is an audience that has been carefully chosen not by the BBC, but by an independent polling organisation to represent the balance between all parties.' Labour leader Ed Miliband gave the Ukip leader the advice: 'It's never a great idea to attack the audience, Nigel, in my opinion.' But Mr Farage retorted: 'The real audience are sitting at home.' Explanation: Mr Farage was heckled before David Dimbleby (pictured), who was presenting the broadcast on BBC1, intervened to say how the audience had been chosen . The BBC insists the audience was carefully selected by an independent pollster, but Mr Farage said something had gone 'wrong' with the process . Unimpressed: Ukip voter Mike Cripps, 44 . A Ukip voter has insisted he is having second thoughts about backing the party after Nigel Farage attacked the studio audience. Security worker Mike Cripps, 44, of Bromley, south-east London, believed the Ukip leader had 'done a couple of stupid things'. The first was his comment on the audience and the second was raising his views on people with HIV visiting the UK for NHS treatment, Mr Cripps said. Asked if Mr Farage's remarks had put him off supporting Ukip, Mr Cripps said: 'It did a bit, yeah. I don't think he put himself across right. 'If we're just talking about the debate tonight - it's what we should be talking about, not what he's done six years ago or two years ago or yesterday - for me, Nicola Sturgeon was the best. 'She was slick, she was well prepared, she had been well briefed, that's my personal opinion. Ed Miliband - it was like he was reading off a script.' The BBC insisted the audience had been chosen by an independent polling organisation to reflect the supporters of all parties - not just those represented by their leaders last night. A spokesman for the corporation told MailOnline yesterday: 'ICM recruited an audience to give a cross section of political opinion.' ICM, a public opinion research company founded in 1989, was unavailable for comment last night. Ukip meanwhile was said to be pressing for an inquiry into how the audience was chosen. Asked after the debate about Mr Farage's criticism of the audience, Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: 'I am not sure whether we will complain. All I will say is I didn't think the audience was representative of the views of British people. 'I think Nigel Farage would have done very well with people sitting at home.' Mr Nuttall said he had spoken about things which had happened to him on Question Time, telling reporters: 'Who knows, may be some people are being disingenuous on their application forms.' Asked if adopting an attack on the audience was an easy get out clause for dismissing opposition to Ukip's views, he added: 'Oh no. People at home agree with us and that's what really matters - the millions of people at home watching this. 'We know, for example, on immigration, on the European Union they agree with where Ukip stands. What the audience in here really think is, I suppose, irrelevant.' Tweeting during the debate, Lord Ashcroft said: 'A minority view once again. Nigel Farage having a go at the BBC audience may well appeal to the viewers whose vote he is targeting.' And Sky News presenter Kay Burley tweeted: 'Farage having a pop at balance of audience. Dodgy ground there. Broadcasters jump through hoops to make sure studio is fair.' As the end credits rolled following the BBC debate last night, four of the five party leaders shook hands with each other - but Mr Farage just drank from a glass of water from behind his stand. As Miss Bennett and Miss Wood walked away, Miss Sturgeon then went to shake Mr Farage's hand - and Mr Miliband offered the Ukip leader a pat on the back. Then, all of the leaders went to the audience to shake their hands - with the exception, again, of Mr Farage. He shook hands with Mr Dimbleby before leaving without going up to the audience.

Summary 2: During a live TV debate at Westminster's Methodist Central Hall, Ukip leader Nigel Farage faced a hostile audience, selected by ICM for the BBC. He remained calm, despite criticism for his comments on immigration's impact on housing. Farage referenced a similar experience on Question Time, where Ukip representatives Douglas Carswell and Patrick O'Flynn also faced a hostile audience.

Summary 3: In a BBC-hosted debate at Westminster's Methodist Central Hall, Ukip leader Nigel Farage faced hostility from an audience selected by ICM.

It can’t receive phone calls, track your exercise or let you send messages, but an old watch made by Apple is on sale via eBay for more than the brand’s latest offering. An analogue promotional watch from Apple with a blue bezel, rubber strap and colourful hands, is listed on the internet auction site with a ‘buy it now’ price of $2,499.99 (£1,707.47) plus postage. For the same price as the 1997 timepiece, Apple fans could pre-order five of the cheapest Apple Watch Sport, which cost £299 in the UK and still have some change. An analogue promotional watch from Apple (pictured) with a blue bezel, rubber strap and colourful hands, is listed on the internet auction site with a ‘buy it now’ price of $2,499.99 (£1,707.47) plus postage . However, it is still cheaper than the Apple Watch Edition, which costs upwards of £8,000 ($10,000). The seller, called ‘theappleipodbay’ calls the watch, which was made by Quartz and released to promote Apple’s Mac Operating system, a ‘rare collector item’. ‘The watch was part of an Apple promo and has been preserved from the 1990s,' the seller wrote on their eBay page. ‘A new battery has been installed and the watch is new, never used or worn.’ It is still in its original box and the seller claims to have two to offload, with 10 days to go. The seller, called ‘theappleipodbay’ calls the watch, which was released to promote Apple’s Mac Operating system, a ‘rare collector item. This image shows the listing on the auction website . Unlike Apple’s new Watch, the vintage model has a circular screen, which has no digital capabilities and shows the company’s old rainbow hue logo. Three versions of Apple's watch (pictured) are available to pre-order online and almost one million orders are thought to have been taken in the US on the first day alone . 'Will the Apple Watch change your life? Well, possibly more than many realise until they start using it. 'After a day or two with the watch, a strange thing happened - I completely stopped checking my phone. 'While Apple may be the firm that really creates phone addiction, meaning we are constantly checking our handsets, with the Apple Watch it may have cured it. 'Apple undoubtedly has another hit on its hands with the watch. 'As more and more apps appear, and developers actually get to spend time with it, I fully expect it be used in ways we can't even imagine now. 'Much like the iPhone, apps could propel this to become a new computing platform - and even with the features it already has, the Apple watch is the most elegant way to communicate digitally.' Unlike Apple’s new smart watch, the vintage model has a circular screen, which has no digital capabilities and shows the company’s old rainbow hue logo. The International Business Times reported that the watch is almost 50 times more valuable – according to its seller – than it was a year ago, thanks to the launch of the new Apple Watch. It’s not known how many of the vintage watches Apple had made at the time, or how many still exist, but one sold on eBay in Match last year for $54 (£37). At the time of writing, two more of the watch model are listed online for $1,000 (£679) and $750 (£510), but neither have fetched that amount of money, suggesting sellers may just be trying their luck. It's thought that Apple sold almost one million Apple Watches in the US alone on the first day that the device could be pre-ordered. It goes on sale in shops in nine countries on April 24. Apple has not confirmed any sales figures, but Tim Cook, interviewed on cable television channel CNBC, said initial orders were 'great.' Slice Intelligence measured digital commerce by tracking consumer receipts to come up with its number of 957,000 American shoppers ordering Apple Watches on the first day that they could do so. Those ordering an Apple Watch Sport, the cheapest version, spent $382.83 per watch and those ordering the Apple Watch spent $707.04. 'As expected, most consumers – 62 percent – purchased the less-expensive Sport model,' said Jaimee Minney of Slice. The data also showed that most consumers opted for the larger 42 mm case. Apple predicted on Thursday that demand would exceed supply at product launch. Soon after online pre-orders opened on Friday, Apple's website listed shipping times in June for some models of the watch and four to six weeks for others. There was immediately brisk bidding on eBay for confirmed orders for watches, with hundreds of sellers looking to make a few hundred or even thousand dollars by passing on their watches, once received. ‘The watch was part of an Apple promo and has been preserved from the 1990s,' the seller wrote. It comes in its original box (pictured) and has a new battery .

Summary 1: This article discusses an old promotional watch made by Apple that is currently listed on eBay. The watch, which features a blue bezel, rubber strap, and colorful hands, is being sold for a 'buy it now' price of $2,499.99. Despite its age and lack of modern features, the watch is still considered a valuable collector's item due to its rarity and connection to the Apple brand.

Summary 2: A 1997 Apple promotional watch, made by Quartz to promote the Mac Operating system, is listed on eBay by 'theappleipodbay' for $2,499.99.

Fighter ace: Douglas Bader's story is to be told in a Hollywood film dubbed ‘The First Great Escape’ The story of how Douglas Bader recovered from having both legs amputated to become one of Britain’s greatest fighter aces is remarkable enough. But now another astonishing but little-known chapter of his war career is to be told in a Hollywood film being dubbed ‘The First Great Escape’. Bader – who lost his legs in a flying accident in 1931 – was shot down over France in August 1941 and ended up in a German prison camp in Warburg. It was there that the officer, who always made light of his disability and refused to even use a stick, was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough. Bader’s life story has already been the subject of the successful film Reach for the Sky in 1956 starring Kenneth More. This latest look at his exploits is based on a book on the Warburg escape by historian Mark Felton called Zero Night. It was a plot hatched by Scottish lieutenant Jock Hamilton-Baillie, 23, and involved build folding ladders to escape over the wire. Major Tom Stallard, of the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. The fighter ace went on to describe it as ‘the most brilliant escape conception of this war’. The ladders were made from wood from a wrecked hut and crafted in the camp’s music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. They were disguised as bookshelves. On the night of the break – August 30, 1942 – the prisoners managed to fuse the camp’s search lights and 41 men carrying four 12ft scaling ladders rushed the fence. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the wire, of which three made a ‘home run’ back to freedom. The Great Escape: Bader's story predates the break in 1944 immortalised in the film starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough (pictured) Bader was among those recaptured but was such a nuisance to the Germans that he ended up in the ‘escape-proof’ Colditz Castle and remained in captivity until the end of the war. More than 40 Allied prisoners put their lives on the line in a plot to escape from Oflag VI-B camp near Warburg, Germany, in 1942. Major Tom Stallard, a larger than life 37-year-old from Somerset captured while serving in the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. While the Great Escape relied on its famous tunnels, the Warburg mass break out saw the men boldly leap over the huge perimeter fences using wooden ladders. Bader described what happened as 'the most brilliant escape conception of this war'. Months of meticulous planning and secret training went into the three minute charge of the camp's double perimeter fences. Bader’s life story has been the subject of 1956 film Reach for the Sky starring Kenneth More (pictured) A series of makeshift ladders propped against the prison camp's perimeter fence were made from wood plundered from a wrecked hut. They were crafted in the camp's music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. The escape was codenamed Operation Olympian because it involved troops from across the Commonwealth - Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The rights to Dr Felton’s book (pictured) have been bought by production firm Essential 11 USA . As the night of the breakout loomed, the ladders were disguised as bookshelves to fool the guards. After the prisoners fused the perimeter search lights, 41 of them carrying four 12-foot scaling ladders made from bed slats rushed to the barbed-wire fence and clambered over. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the barbed wire, of which three made a 'home run' back to freedom. Bader later ended up in Colditz and had his tin legs taken away to ensure he remained in captivity until the end of the war. Major Stallard and another leading light of the escape Major Johnnie Cousens, also of the Durham Light Infantry, survived the war and lived into their 70s. Both were too modest to breathe hardly a word about what had happened on August 30 1942. But now their story could trump the Great Escape after Hollywood bosses snapped up the rights to turn military historian Mark Felton's book about the escape Zero Night into a blockbuster. The rights to Dr Felton’s book have been bought by the makers of 2013’s Saving Mr Banks with Tom Hanks. Production firm Essential 11 USA, the makers of the 2013 Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson hit Saving Mr Banks, is now working on a script. Dr Felton said a number of 'A-list' Hollywood stars were queuing up for roles and Essential 11 had invited him to help cast the leads, although he could not reveal who was interested. He said: 'I'm very, very pleased. It's very, very exciting. Essential 11 did a fantastic job with Saving Mr Banks and to have that same team working on this is very pleasing.'

Summary 1: Douglas Bader, a legless British fighter ace, is the focus of 'The First Great Escape', a Hollywood film about his time in Warburg prison camp. The escape plan, detailed in Mark Felton's book 'Zero Night', was devised by Bader, Major Tom Stallard, and Scottish lieutenant Jock Hamilton-Baillie. They constructed ladders from wrecked huts to scale the camp's fences.

Summary 2: 'The First Great Escape' tells of Douglas Bader's escape from Warburg prison camp, planned with Major Tom Stallard and Jock Hamilton-Baillie. Their 'Operation Olympian' involved ladders and occurred on August 30, 1942, with 28 prisoners escaping. Bader was recaptured and sent to Colditz Castle. Essential 11 USA, makers of 'Saving Mr Banks', hold the film rights.

Summary 3: This article discusses the life of Douglas Bader, a British fighter ace who lost both legs but continued to serve in the military. His story is being adapted into a Hollywood film titled 'The First Great Escape'. The film will focus on Bader's time in the Warburg prison camp in Germany, where he was involved in a mass escape attempt.

Summary 4: The film 'The First Great Escape' recounts Douglas Bader's daring escape from Warburg prison camp, as detailed in 'Zero Night'. Bader, Major Tom Stallard, and Jock Hamilton-Baillie built ladders for the escape, codenamed 'Operation Olympian'. The film rights to 'Zero Night' were acquired by Essential 11 USA, the production company behind 'Saving Mr Banks'.

Baby Malakai has been alive for seven months and he's never left the hospital. The newborn cannot see, cannot hear and struggles to breath. Doctors say he may not ever be able to walk. Having been diagnosed with a rare medical condition known as Pallister Killian Syndrome (PKS), his mother had to give up her job in Perth in order to provide full-time care for her son. Without an income, Stacy Maitai has been forced to survive on welfare funding of $90 a week to support her baby and her seven-year-old daughter. And the 28-year-old is not eligible for further financial assistance from Centrelink as she is not an Australian citizen. Scroll down for video . Baby Malakai (pictured) has been alive for seven months and he's never left the walls of the hospital . Mother Stacy Maitai had to give up her job in Perth in order to care for her son full-time . The newborn cannot see, cannot hear and struggles to breath. Doctors say he may not be able to walk . About 15 to 20 cases of PKS are known to be in Australia, according to the Pallister Killian Syndrome Foundation of Australia . PKS is a rare chromosomal disorder which affects about 200 people worldwide and 15 those cases are known to be in Australia, according to the Pallister Killian Syndrome Foundation of Australia. It is commonly undiagnosed during pregnancy and is discovered at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complications such as developmental delays, seizures and congenital heart defects. Ms Maitai has told of the heartbreaking moment she learnt about her son's condition. 'I wanted to commit suicide because I thought it was all my fault,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'But then I found myself having to choose whether to escape all this and give up my son or be strong for my children by moving forward and staying with them every step of the way. 'It's been a difficult journey so far but also a blessing because I have found hope in Malakai and I know he will make it through.' The condition is often undiagnosed during pregnancy and is identified at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complication . Ms Maitai said she was heartbroken when she learnt about her son's condition . A fundraising page was set up to help the struggling family on mycause , so far raising more than $18,000 . While Ms Maitai juggles her time between the hospital with Malakai (left) and at home her seven-year-old daughter Serenity (right) The single mother says she is trying her best to keep food on the table but was given an eviction notice after being $4000 behind in her rent for her three-bedroom home, which costs $380 . While Ms Maitai juggles her time between the hospital with Malakai and at home with her seven-year-old daughter Serenity, the financial strain of being without a job and dependent on $90 from welfare is taking its toll. The single mother says she is trying her best to keep food on the table but was given an eviction notice after being $4000 behind in her rent for her three-bedroom home, which costs $380 each week. A fundraising page on mycause was set up to help the struggling family, which at the time of publication raised more than $18,000. 'Our power was cut off and I thought we were going to be thrown onto the street,' Ms Maitai said. 'Luckily we've been able to use some of that fundraising money to take it straight to the real estate agent who was understanding enough to let us stay even though we had been behind in rent. 'You know, I came to Australia for a better life and I love it here. It's changed my life. I worked since moving here about four years ago and paid all my taxes. 'I was shocked when Centrelink told me I couldn't get any more assistance because I'm a Kiwi. 'With what I currently get every fortnight, it's hard to afford even just the basic things.' Not having grown up with a proper mother and father figure back in New Zealand, Ms Maitai is determined to give her children the life she never hard. 'I want to be a better parent and I want to be there for my kids,' she said. 'It's just a waiting game with Malakai and the doctors even asked me if I wanted to look after him even with his condition and I said yes. I chose to be there for him and he will make it through - I just know it.' Pallister Killian Syndrome, also known as PKS, is a rare chromosomal disorder. According to the PKS Foundation of Australia, about 200 to 300 cases of PKS have been reported worldwide. About 15 to 20 are known to be in Australia. 'Most of these cases have been diagnosed in the last five years with an increasing diagnosis rate,' the foundation states.

(CNN)Eleven channels associated with the French-language global television network TV5Monde went black late Wednesday due to an "extremely powerful cyberattack," the network's director said. In addition to its 11 channels, TV5Monde also temporarily lost control of its social media outlets and its websites, director Yves Bigot said in a video message posted later on Facebook. On a mobile site, which was still active, the network said it was "hacked by an Islamist group." ISIS logos and markings could be seen on some TV5Monde social media accounts. But there was no immediate claim of responsibility by ISIS or any other group.

Bryony Hibbert (pictured), 25,  the girlfriend of the footballer caught having drunken sex in the dugout, has slammed those responsible for the clip . This is the first picture of the girlfriend of the semi-professional footballer caught having drunken sex with a female supporter in the dugout after his team's 4-1 defeat. Striker Jay Hart, 24, could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs. He was dismissed after the sex clip of his tryst at Mossley AFC in Tameside was shared on social media and has now begged for his 25-year-old girlfriend Bryony Hibbert's forgiveness. The 73rd minute substitute for non-league Clitheroe FC, in Lancashire, today admitted he had no idea who the woman was and reached out to Wayne Rooney on Twitter for advice. Speaking for the first time since he was caught in the act, he said: 'All I want say is that I regret doing what I did. 'I was drunk, I'd had more than a few drinks, and I want to say I'm sorry to my family and everyone involved at clitheroe. 'I regret that I did it, not that I got caught. 'I've spoken and tried to sort things out with Bryony . 'Everyone in the world knows about it, I just want to get my apology out there. 'I haven't seen the girl since, I don't have a clue who she is, don't have a clue.' His team had just suffered a 4-1 defeat at Mossley's Seel Park stadium in the final game of the season which was billed as a 'ladies day' to attract more female supporters. The face of the blonde fan cannot be seen in the close-up footage. Hart was sacked by the club, which play in Evo-Stik Division 1 North, within hours of the footage being shared to fans. His girlfriend Bryony Hibbert, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, who has two young children, slammed those responsible for filming and sharing the clip. Writing on the Clitheroe Football Club Facebook page, she said: 'Have a bit of decency for the people it's affected. Thank God my kids are too young to read. It's disgusting. I bet their families are far from perfect.' Striker Jay Hart, 24,  could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde still in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs . One person who saw the film, which was shared on Twitter and Instagram, said Mr Hart was unaware he was being filmed at first. He said: 'The camera came round the dugout and there was a blonde female with her head down. The man couldn't see the camera because his eyes were closed. 'After a few seconds, he opened his eyes and laughed and the camera panned away again. I've been to Mossley AFC a few times and it's clearly their ground. The whole clip is only 10 to 15 seconds.' Mr Hart said he thinks of Ms Hibbert's  children as his own and hasn't seen them since the incident. His mother, Dawn Hart 46, also revealed Jay's younger sisters have been targeted by trolls, with someone sending the video to the youngest, aged nine. 'I know he's done wrong, but at the end of the day, he's my son and to see what people are saying about him, it's not nice,' she said. Mr Hart could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde . 'People have done a lot worse. Someone sent the video to my girls as well. 'They know something's gone on but they don't know what exactly, and to have to explain it to them when someone sends them something like that is horrible. 'It's had a knock on effect on his girls as well.' Clitheroe chairwoman Anne Barker said the player had 'brought the club into disrepute'. She said: 'I can't have somebody wearing the Clitheroe FC tracksuit bringing us down. 'It has brought the club into disrepute and it's not proper for him to scupper our reputation. I expect our players to act professionally. 'It was brought to my attention on Saturday night and dealt with through the management. I did offer to speak to him myself but Simon (Garner, the manager) said he would take care of it.' Mr Hart previously played for Colne FC and Padiham FC before joining Clitheroe, who currently sit 14th in the Evo-Stik League First Division North. First team manager Simon Garner, who signed Mr Hart, said: 'At the time of this unfortunate occurrence on Saturday, I wasn't there. I had already left the ground. 'I found out later on when I saw how it played out in Twitter. I'm disappointed but we can't control what the players do outside the time we are with them. 'They choose what they want to do. Unfortunately, Jason was wearing the club tracksuit and he knows he has let the club down, so the club has done what it has done. 'He's disappointed it has gone this far. It's going to have consequences for him beyond leaving this football club; with his family and possibly beyond that. 'Football is only a small part of it. If he had thought about what would have happened when he did it, he wouldn't have done it. He will pay for it. 'When I spoke to him, he sounded very apologetic about it. I'm disappointed for him. He will regret what he did and it was totally wrong.' No-one from Mossley AFC was available for comment yesterday.

Article:
A British couple who are believed to have fled their Berkshire home with their four young children in a bid to escape to Syria have reportedly been arrested in Turkey. Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara Kiran, 29, and their four children were caught on CCTV boarding a cross-Channel ferry from Dover earlier this month. Thames Valley Police believed they arrived in Calais, France, before travelling south down through Europe in a bid to flee to Syria. However, a Turkish official claimed today that the couple had been arrested in Ankara and are currently in custody with their four children - daughter Zoha, seven, and three sons Essa, four, Zakariva, two, and Yahya, one. Photos released by the Turkish government show Asif Malik (left) and his partner Sara Kiran (right) pushing prams for their young children. They have been arrested by police in Ankara as they tried to go to Syria . Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara Kiran, 29, and their four young children have reportedly been arrested in Ankara, Turkey. The family of six have been missing from their home in Slough, Berkshire, since April 7 . The family, who were spotted on CCTV at Dover catching a ferry to France on April 8 (pictured), were not reported missing by their relatives until eight days later. Police fear they may have been trying to get to Syria . Malik, 31, who has fled the UK with his family, was pictured at a protest outside the Lebanese embassy in London in May last year holding a pro-ISIS poster. The large poster stated 'Stop Terrorism Against Sunnis' Earlier, British authorities had said that there was no suggestion the family was doing any fighting in Syria, and it was unclear whether they were sympathetic to members of the Islamic State group or Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But earlier today, the Mail revealed how Malik was pictured waving a flag in support of ISIS at a demonstration in London last year. The photograph shows Malik - a member of the banned UK extremist group al-Mujahiroun - holding a pro-ISIS sign at a protest against the arrest of hate preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad in May last year. The picture, taken by extremism researcher Jacob Michelson, shows the 31-year-old standing outside the Lebanese embassy in London brandishing a poster which reads 'Islamic State Is Solution', with the first letter of each word highlighted to spell out 'ISIS'. Bakri, who led a number of hate groups in Britain before being kicked out of the UK, was arrested in Lebanon in May, and is believed still to be in detention there. Earlier today Ms Kiran's family made an emotional appeal directly to her, urging her to get in touch so that they know the family is safe. 'We would like to urge you, Sara and Asif, to make contact with us and let us know that you and the children are safe,' relatives said in a statement. 'Sara, we want to let you know that we love you - we miss you, Asif and the grandchildren. You are not in trouble, we are not angry or upset, and we just want you to return home safely.' Thames Valley Police said yesterday that the Malik family were last seen on Tuesday April 7 but were only reported missing to police last Thursday, April 16. Malik (left) and Dhar (right) are pictured at a protest outside outside Regent's Park Mosque in May last year . Asif Malik (left) and his partner Sara Kiran (right) disappeared from their home in Berkshire this month . Malik and Ms Kiran, who neighbours said usually wore the full Islamic veil, left home without mentioning any holiday or travel plans to family members, which a force spokesman said was 'entirely out of character for this family'. Police said the family boarded a ferry from Dover to Calais at 12.30am on Wednesday, April 8. Neighbours said the alarm was raised after at least one of their four children failed to attend school. Their grandmother was also seen looking for them and knocking on other doors in the modern block of flats where they lived, asking if anyone had seen the family. Neither Malik nor his partner have attempted to contact any family members or friends since, despite taking their mobile phones with them on the trip, police said. Police said the lack of contact led detectives to believe their reason for leaving Britain may not be legitimate. Deputy Chief Constable John Campbell said yesterday: 'Given the online rhetoric from the Islamic State encouraging people to travel to Syria, the direction of travel and concerns voiced by Asif's family, we are concerned the family may be seeking to travel to Syria.' Anjem Choudary confirmed yesterday that Malik had been a member of al-Mujahiroun, and described him as a 'champion for shariah' who regularly attended the group's events and demonstrations. The Malik family's last known address in Slough, Berkshire, was in the block of flats on the left of this image . Siddhartha Dhar posted this picture of himself with a gun and his newborn baby on Twitter shortly after arriving in Syria last year. Dhar fled to Syria with his pregnant wife and three young children last year . Both Malik and Dhar are believed to be followers of notorious preacher Anjem Choudary (pictured above) Dhar - one of Choudary's top henchmen - fled to Syria with his pregnant wife and three young children last year while under investigation by Scotland Yard. He was one of nine men who were detained on September 25 last year on suspicion of encouraging terrorism and supporting al-Muhajiroun. Just hours after publicly declaring he had arrived in Syria, Dhar announced he had become a father to a baby boy who was a member of the latest generation of Islamist extremists. He wrote: 'Alhamdulillah, Allah blessed me with a healthy baby boy in the Islamic State. He is another great addition to the Islamic State. And he's definitely not British.' In a picture posted on Twitter at the time, Dhar was seen posing with an AK47 in one hand and his new-born baby in the other while standing in front of a mustard-coloured pickup truck, wearing a thick military style coat and boots. Two other followers of Choudary who have left Britain to join a terror group are Abu Rahin Aziz, from Luton, and former NHS surgeon Mirza Tariq Ali. Aziz skipped bail before he was handed a 36-week jail sentence in absence for attacking a football fan in London's West End, while Ali was arrested for repeatedly assaulting a bystander at a rally and was reported to have been killed while fighting with the Taliban last month.
