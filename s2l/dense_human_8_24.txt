Article:
Catania, Sicily (CNN)We are at the beginning of a massive and mounting crisis with no solution in sight. Perhaps that's incorrect. The migrant crisis that has suddenly drawn hundreds of journalists to Sicily has been brewing for years, but in the past 10 days, with as many as 1,600 deaths in the Mediterranean, suddenly minds are focused -- for now. Almost exactly four years ago, in Libya, I caught, perhaps, a glimpse of what was to come. It was late at night in the besieged city of Misrata. Hundreds of African migrants were caught between the Libyan civil war (back then some optimistically called it a "revolution") and the deep blue sea. They had come to Misrata from Ghana, Nigeria and elsewhere, hoping to board rickety boats to cross the sea to Europe. They had been pinned down under sporadic shelling from government forces, but weren't welcome by the rebels who controlled the city. They appealed to us to help them escape. We could do nothing, but they may have eventually found their way out when the fighting subsided. The fall of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's regime, which we reporters covered so avidly, was followed by chaos, which we in the news media largely neglected, focused as we journalists were on the next catastrophe, the Syrian civil war. In that chaos, the business of human trafficking has boomed. And now that boom in human misery is coming in waves to the shores of Italy. The focus today is on those lost at sea. Aware of the tragedy underway, however, Italians are alarmed at the prospect that this year alone as many as a million migrants could arrive in Europe, according to one European Union official. That is certainly the case in the Sicilian port of Catania, where many migrants arrive. The city's mayor, Enzo Bianco, insists city residents bear no ill will toward the migrants, but says Catania, and Sicily cannot absorb the ever-growing numbers. The rest of Europe must help carry the burden. "If something serious isn't done," he warns, "dramas like these will be repeated. This problem will not be resolved by hiding our heads in the sand." Increasingly, some Italians are losing their patience. Two northern regions, Veneto and Valle d'Aosta, have declared they will no longer accept new migrants. The rightist Lega Nord has made opposition to new migrants a pillar of its party program. Others, however, insist Italy must keep its doors open. In Catania port, I spoke with Grazia Giurato, who had joined a small protest in solidarity with the migrants. "Many years ago, our grandparents emigrated," she recalled. "Let's keep that in mind." Indeed, in tougher times, millions of impoverished Italians left their homeland to settle in the Americas and Australia. They, too, like the migrants from Africa and the Middle East, were fleeing grinding poverty and war. And they, too, experienced the kind of prejudice and resentment in lands their descendants now proudly call home. That's the long view, perhaps. But now, today, Italians are grappling to deal with the consequences of an array of old and new ills, ranging from failing states and failing economies to endemic corruption, hopeless poverty, oppression and injustice that no one state or group of states can solve without a gargantuan, expensive and politically daunting effort. And while this crisis has been brewing for years, it is now truly upon us.

Summary 1: This article describes a growing migrant crisis that has been brewing for years, but has recently drawn significant attention due to a surge in fatalities. The crisis is particularly noticeable in Sicily, where hundreds of journalists have arrived to report on the situation. In the past 10 days alone, as many as 1,600 deaths have occurred in the Mediterranean, bringing the issue into sharp focus. However, the article suggests that there is no immediate solution in sight for this complex and escalating problem.

Summary 2: The escalating migrant crisis, rooted in the Libyan civil war and subsequent human trafficking boom, has drawn global attention with 1,600 Mediterranean deaths in 10 days. Sicily, particularly Catania, is a major arrival point. Catania's mayor, Enzo Bianco, calls for Europe's help, as Sicily cannot absorb the growing numbers. Italians are alarmed, with predictions of a million migrants this year. Resistance is growing, with northern regions Veneto and Valle d'Aosta refusing new migrants.

Summary 3: The migrant crisis, particularly visible in Sicily, has roots in the Libyan civil war, where African migrants were caught between conflict and the perilous journey to Europe. The fall of Gadhafi's regime led to chaos, fostering a boom in human trafficking. In the past 10 days, 1,600 deaths in the Mediterranean have drawn global attention, but no immediate solution is apparent. Italians are increasingly alarmed, with predictions of up to a million migrants arriving in Europe this year alone.

Summary 4: The migrant crisis, intensified by the Libyan civil war and human trafficking, has seen 1,600 Mediterranean deaths in 10 days. Sicily, especially Catania, is a key arrival point. Mayor Enzo Bianco urges Europe's help, as Sicily can't handle the influx. Italians, alarmed by predictions of a million migrants this year, face resistance from northern regions. Grazia Giurato, a protester, reminds Italians of their own emigration history. Today, Italy grapples with old and new ills, including failing states and economies.

Article:
Washington (CNN)One former employee of the private Blackwater Worldwide security company was sentenced Monday to life in prison and three others to 30 years each behind bars for their roles in a 2007 mass shooting in Baghdad that left 17 people dead. A federal jury convicted the four in October after a lengthy trial that saw some 30 witnesses travel from Iraq to testify against the security contractors. Prosecutors accused the men of illegally unleashed "powerful sniper fire, machine guns and grenade launchers on innocent men, women and children." Senior U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth sentenced Blackwater sniper Nicholas Slatten to a term of life in prison, mandatory for his first-degree murder conviction. Blackwater workers Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard were sentenced to 30 year each, plus one day. Slough was convicted of 13 counts of voluntary manslaughter, 17 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. The jury convicted Liberty of eight counts of voluntary manslaughter, 12 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. Heard was found guilty of six counts of voluntary manslaughter, 11 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. According to prosecutors, the four were among seven Blackwater employees who opened fire in the Nusoor Square traffic circle in Baghdad, killing 17 people. An FBI investigation found 14 of the deaths unjustified, according to rules of engagement for private security contractors in Iraq. Slatten was accused of firing the first shots. Survivors of shooting tell FBI their stories in 2007 . Blackwater said its convoy came under attack, and defense attorneys said in court that witness accounts were fabricated. But witnesses testified that the contractors opened fire without provocation. "It was horror," said Hasan Jaber, an attorney who was driving to work when he was shot three times. "People running out of their cars were being shot at. ... Anything that moved in Nusoor Square was shot. Women, children, young people, they shot everyone." Among the dead were two boys, 9 and 11, a doctor, a used car salesman, a truck driver, a businessman, an Iraqi soldier, a gardener, a taxi driver and an aspiring doctor taking his mother to an appointment, according to prosecutors. The parents and brothers of the 9-year-old victim were present in court during the sentencing hearing and spoke. Ali Razzaq's father looked at the defendants and yelled in broken English: "If I kill anyone in his family, what he do?! Today, we will see who will win, the law or Blackwater," he said. "Blackwater killed my son." Dad in 2007: Blackwater blew up son's and wife's 'skulls' The defense presented character witnesses, family members and former colleagues who testified to the defendants' capacity to work under fire and willingness to help others. Each defendant also gave a closing statement. Slatten addressed the court last, taking the opportunity to declare his innocence. Lamberth rejected his argument. The judge said that the punishments reflected the seriousness of the crimes. He said that the U.S. government "should be commended for finding and exposing the truth of what happened." Blackwater incident witness in 2007: 'It was hell' A few gasps were heard in the courtroom, and some crying. The case was initially dismissed in 2008 after a judge found the Justice Department withheld key evidence and violated the rights of the contractors. A federal appeals court reversed the ruling, paving the way for the two-month trial that ended in convictions for the four. Another contractor, Jeremy Ridgeway, pleaded guilty in 2008 to voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter and testified for the government. He has not yet been sentenced. Blackwater lost its $1 billion contract with the State Department to protect American diplomatic personnel in 2009, after the Iraqi government refused to renew the company's operating license. The company was later renamed and sold, and now operates as ACADEMI, providing protection services and training. 2007 congressional report: Blackwater most often shoots first .

(CNN)It was like a scene out of "Make Way for Ducklings" on Tuesday on a rainy street in Washington. CNN Situation Room correspondent Brian Todd and photojournalist Khalil Abdallah were on their way to interview a legal analyst on L Street NW when they happened on a brood of baby ducks causing a stir. Abdallah reports the ducklings and their mom had crossed heavily trafficked street, and some restaurant patrons stopped on the sidewalk to corral them. A man gave up his umbrella for the cause "while the mom was going crazy." "One duckling tried to run back to the street but they caught it in time," Abdallah said. The mother duck followed the umbrella while pedestrians stopped cars on L street for them to safely cross the road. The Washington Post reports the pedestrians took the bird family to "a more enclosed grassy area" at 16th and L streets NW. (Yes, baby ducks warrant two national news stories.) "We thought it was an extraordinary situation," Todd said. "You see pigeons, you see squirrels, you see the occasional raccoon in the D.C. area, and ... you  see deer ... We've never seen anything like this in the middle of town."

Article:
Kolo Toure has warned Raheem Sterling that leaving Liverpool could see him end up on the scrapheap at a big club, similar to the way that Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair did at Manchester City. Sterling stunned Liverpool earlier this week, giving an interview confirming that he has turned down a new £100,000-a-week contract and admitting he is 'quite flattered' by interest from Arsenal. Chelsea and Manchester City are also keen on English football's hottest property. But Toure, who used to play for  City with Rodwell and Sinclair, has warned his Anfield team-mate a move to one of European football's heavyweights may not be everything he has dreamed of. Raheem Sterling has been warned about the dangers of leaving Liverpool by his team-mate Kolo Toure . Toure compared Sterling's situation with that of Jack Rodwell (left) and Scott Sinclair joining Manchester City . Toure (centre) says Liverpool is the best place for Sterling to stay and continue his development as a player . After starring in Everton's midfield and making his England debut, Jack Rodwell was being linked with every big club around. Sir Alex Ferguson was known to be an admirer but Rodwell was snapped up by Manchester City for £12million. Repeated injury problems and the presence of Yaya Toure, David Silva, Samir Nasri and Javi Garcia saw his appearances limited, while Fernandinho arrived for £30m the next summer. After just seven league starts in two years, Rodwell moved on to relegation-threatened Sunderland for £10m. It was a similar story for Scott Sinclair. After powering Swansea City's promotion to the Premier League and scoring eight times in the top flight, Chelsea youth product Sinclair moved to City for £8m. But he too struggled with the competition in City's squad and moved to West Bromwich Albion on loan last season. He found it hard to break into the team there and returned to City before heading out on loan again to Aston Villa in January where he has found some form. Rodwell joined City in a £12million deal in 2012, while Sinclair made the same move from Swansea City for an £8m fee later that summer. The English pair made just nine Barclays Premier League appearances between them across two seasons at the Etihad Stadium. Rodwell joined relegation-threatened Sunderland last summer to end his City nightmare while Sinclair is trying to rebuild his career at Aston Villa. Toure says Sterling could be making a similar mistake by leaving Anfield. 'Both Rodwell and Sinclair went to a club where there is big competition and didn't play,' Toure said. 'If Raheem left Liverpool he wouldn't be sure to start games. Make a mistake or don't score for two games and he will be on the bench. There is no messing at clubs like that.' Brendan Rodgers used his pre-match press conference ahead of Saturday's trip to Arsenal to reiterate that Sterling was not for sale, and Toure sees Liverpool as the perfect place for the 20-year-old to continue his development. 'I'm not surprised there's speculation because everybody would want to have a player like him,' he told the Liverpool ECHO. 'But he needs to stay here. Liverpool is a great place for him. Sterling stunned Liverpool this week, giving an interview confirming that he had turned down a new deal . The likes of Chelsea, City and Arsenal would have big competition in their squads for a place . 'This is definitely the best place for him to continue his development. At Liverpool, he's beginning to be one of the most important players. He's playing every week. 'If he went to another club there would be big challenges he would face. He wouldn't be the most important player.' Sportsmail revealed on Thursday that Chelsea had joined the race to sign England star Sterling, with the Premier League leaders wanting to be kept informed of any developments in his contract situation. Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are also monitoring the developments in his stand-off at Anfield. Rodwell made just seven Premier League starts for City during his two-year spell before leaving the club . The former Everton man now plays for relegation-threatened Sunderland after a tough time at City . Sinclair's spell was even more difficult, he made just two league starts for City before moving out on loan . Sinclair is on loan at Aston Villa as he looks to rebuild his reputation as a young England talent . Doubts over Arsenal’s ability to fund a move have seen their interest questioned, but they are confident they have the financial firepower to compete for him with the likes of Chelsea and City. Liverpool boss Rodgers said on Thursday: ‘He’s got two-and-a-half years to go on his deal and he’s not going anywhere in the summer. 'I cannot speak for the owners but I have a good idea of what they would do. I know them well enough and for me it would not happen. Liverpool are one of the superpowers of football and the owners have made it clear that money doesn’t come into it. If the club doesn’t want to sell, it won’t sell, it’s as simple as that. Money has never been the objective for the club. ‘Whatever player - Raheem or anybody - it would always be on the terms of the club. ‘He still has two-and-a- bit years left of his deal so it’s not something we’re overly concerned about. I’m confident that at the end of the season we’ll find the solution.’ Brendan Rodgers has said Sterling is going nowhere this summer despite the speculation over his future . Sinclair spent more time on the bench than the pitch at City, and Toure thinks it could be similar for Sterling .

Summary 1: Liverpool's Kolo Toure warns teammate Raheem Sterling about the dangers of leaving for a bigger club, citing Jack Rodwell's experience at Manchester City as a cautionary tale. Rodwell, who joined City for £12million, struggled with injuries and competition, limiting his appearances. Sterling, having rejected a £100,000-a-week contract from Liverpool, is being courted by Arsenal, Chelsea, and City. Despite this, Toure advises Sterling to stay at Liverpool for his career development.

Summary 2: Liverpool's Kolo Toure cautions Raheem Sterling about moving to a bigger club, referencing Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair's limited playtime at Manchester City. Rodwell, a £12million acquisition, and Sinclair, an £8m purchase from Swansea City, both faced competition. Sterling, who turned down a £100,000-a-week Liverpool contract, is eyed by Arsenal, Chelsea, and City. Despite this, Toure and Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insist Liverpool is the best place for Sterling's career, amid his contract situation.

Summary 3: This article discusses the advice given by Kolo Toure, a Liverpool player, to his teammate Raheem Sterling. Toure warns Sterling about the potential pitfalls of leaving Liverpool for a larger club, drawing parallels to the experiences of Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair at Manchester City. Sterling, who recently rejected a new contract offer from Liverpool, has attracted interest from several top clubs, including Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester City. However, Toure believes that staying at Liverpool would be the best decision for Sterling's career development.

Summary 4: Kolo Toure, a Liverpool player, advises Raheem Sterling against leaving for a larger club, using Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair's experiences at Manchester City as examples. Rodwell, bought for £12million, and Sinclair, acquired from Swansea City for £8m, both struggled with limited playtime. Sterling, who declined a £100,000-a-week Liverpool contract, is attracting interest from Arsenal, Chelsea, and City. However, Toure recommends Liverpool as the best place for Sterling's career growth.

(CNN)You know the phrase "dodging a bullet"? Forget about it. Probably not going to happen anymore. The U.S. military said this week it has made great progress in its effort to develop a self-steering bullet. In February, the "smart bullets" -- .50-caliber projectiles equipped with optical sensors -- passed their most successful round of live-fire tests to date, according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In the tests, an experienced marksman "repeatedly hit moving and evading targets," a DARPA statement said. "Additionally," the statement said, "a novice shooter using the system for the first time hit a moving target." In other words, now you don't even have to be a good shot to hit the mark. The system has been developed by DARPA's Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance program, known as EXACTO. "True to DARPA's mission, EXACTO has demonstrated what was once thought impossible: the continuous guidance of a small-caliber bullet to target," said Jerome Dunn, DARPA program manager. "This live-fire demonstration from a standard rifle showed that EXACTO is able to hit moving and evading targets with extreme accuracy at sniper ranges unachievable with traditional rounds. Fitting EXACTO's guidance capabilities into a small .50-caliber size is a major breakthrough and opens the door to what could be possible in future guided projectiles across all calibers," Dunn said. Videos supplied by DARPA show the bullets making sharp turns in midair as they pursue their targets. It all conjures up images of a cartoon character frantically fleeing a bullet that follows him wherever he goes. Only, these bullets are traveling at hundreds of miles per hour. And even the Road Runner can't run that fast. DARPA says the smart bullets will also help shooters who are trying, for example, to hit targets in high winds. The goals of the EXACTO program are giving shooters accuracy at greater distances, engaging targets sooner and enhancing the safety of American  troops, DARPA said.

Summary 1: The U.S. military's EXACTO program, managed by Jerome Dunn under DARPA, has developed a .50-caliber self-steering bullet. This 'smart bullet' demonstrates continuous guidance and extreme accuracy, hitting moving targets at sniper ranges, even in high winds. The successful live-fire tests mark a major breakthrough for future guided projectiles. The EXACTO program's goal is to enhance the safety and accuracy of American troops.

Summary 2: DARPA's EXACTO program, under the U.S. military, has developed a self-steering bullet of .50-caliber size. Jerome Dunn, the program manager, confirmed the bullets' ability to hit moving targets, even in high winds, at sniper ranges. These 'smart bullets', equipped with optical sensors, have shown success in live-fire tests, marking a significant advancement in guided projectiles. The EXACTO program aims to enhance the safety and accuracy of American troops.

Summary 3: This article describes the U.S. military's recent advancements in developing a self-steering bullet. The 'smart bullets', as they are referred to, have undergone successful live-fire tests, according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). These bullets are equipped with optical sensors and have shown the ability to hit moving and evading targets, even when used by a novice shooter. The development of this system is a significant breakthrough in the field of guided projectiles.

Summary 4: The U.S. military, through DARPA's EXACTO program, has made significant strides in creating a self-steering bullet. Jerome Dunn, DARPA program manager, stated that the 'smart bullets' have demonstrated the ability to guide a small-caliber bullet to a target, a feat previously thought impossible. The bullets, equipped with optical sensors, have successfully hit moving targets in live-fire tests, even at sniper ranges. This development is a major breakthrough in guided projectiles.

New York (CNN)New York state authorities have issued a health alert following a dramatic spike in hospital visits for synthetic marijuana-related emergencies. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday that more than 160 patients in nine days have been rushed to hospitals across the state for adverse reactions to synthetic cannabinoid, known as "spice" or "K2." "Spice" and other similar synthetic drugs are often marketed as legal plant material coated with chemicals that are supposed to mimic the effects of marijuana, according to a statement from the governor's office. "Since the exact compounds contained in synthetic cannabinoid products change so frequently, it's often impossible for users to know exactly what they are putting in their body," acting New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said. Symptoms after use have a wide range of severity, from confusion, drowsiness and headaches to increased heart rate, seizures and loss of consciousness, according to the New York State Department of Health. Synthetic marijuana is popular among teens because it is marketed as incense or natural products to "mask its true purpose," the health department statement said. "Young people may be fooled into thinking that these substances are safe because they are sold over the counter or are in colorful packaging, but they are not made for human consumption," New York Alcohol and Substance Abuse Service s Commissioner Arlene Gonzalez Sanchez said. "They are dangerous and can have significant, long-term effects on the brain." The recent surge is not isolated in New York; other states across the country have noticed similar trends. Alabama Department of Public Health issued a statement last week acknowledging a rise of synthetic marijuana usage and said there had been 98 overdoses suspected to be linked with "spice" in the previous month. Mobile County alone has seen seven cases in 2015 so far, more than the entire previous year, the statement said. Mississippi health officials are also concerned that synthetic marijuana is on the rise. Ninety-seven  cases over an eight-day span in April were reported to the Mississippi Poison Control Center, a Department of Health press release said.

(CNN)Canadian actor Jonathan Crombie, who co-starred in the "Anne of Green Gables" TV movies, died this week at age 48. Crombie died Wednesday from complications of a brain hemorrhage, "Anne of Green Gables" producer Kevin Sullivan said. "It's a real tragedy to see someone at age 48 go like that," he said. "I will remember him as someone who worked extremely hard to make the roles he played onscreen come to life." Based on Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery's children's books, "Anne of Green Gables" debuted in Canada on CBC TV in 1984 and became a cultural touchstone. The plot focused on the adventures of fiery orphan Anne Shirley, played by Megan Follows, who is sent to live on a farm in Prince Edward Island. Crombie played Gilbert Blythe, who evolves over time from Anne's pigtail-tugging tormentor to friend to husband. Follows and Crombie reprised the roles in the sequels "Anne of Avonlea" (1987) and "Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story" (2000). The movies were carried in the United States by the Disney Channel and PBS, drawing a cult following beyond Canada and extending to Japan, which made its own animated series based on the books. Crombie, son of former Toronto Mayor David Crombie, was cast in the role at 17, beating out other aspiring Canadian actors of the era, including Jason Priestly, Sullivan said. Despite his lack of acting experience, Crombie's boy-next-door looks and cool demeanor made him the perfect actor to star opposite Follows, Sullivan said. "It was an amazing chemistry between him and Megan Follows," Sullivan said. "There was a lot of affection, but they kind of grounded each other." The movies spawned various spinoffs, including "Road to Avonlea," starring child actor Sarah Polley, and turned Anne's fictional home on Prince Edward Island into a popular tourist destination. The role made Crombie a heartthrob of his time, a sentiment expressed by many fans in the wake of his death. As one person said on Twitter, "I don't know any female Canadian from my generation that *didn't* have at least a little bit of a crush on Jonathan Crombie as Gilbert." Crombie went on to play roles in other American and Canadian TV shows, including "21 Jump Street" and "The Good Wife," but even his Facebook page acknowledges he is best known for his portrayal of Gilbert Blythe. Crombie's sister told CBC News that her brother happily answered to the name Gil when greeted by fans in public. "I think he was really proud of being Gilbert Blythe," she said. "He really enjoyed that series and was happy, very proud of it -- we all were." People we've lost in 2015 .

(CNN)Sophisticated, glamorous and spacious -- when the super-rich go house-hunting they are searching for something special. Real estate in London's swankier suburbs can catch a buyers' eye. Mayfair, Kensington and Chelsea have long been the stomping ground of the elite -- and are now welcoming a new wave of African investors. "The Africans who are coming into London now are Africans who themselves have worked for their money," explains Bimpe Nkontchou, a British-Nigerian wealth manager based in London. "They have grown in industry and are actually part of the exciting story of the African renaissance," she continues. "It's bringing to London the best of the continent." These investors are having a considerable impact on London's property market and they mainly come from just six countries: Nigeria, Ghana, Congo, Gabon, Cameroon and Senegal. Of these, Nigerians are splashing out the most cash when it comes to bricks and mortar in the British capital -- typically spending between $22 and $37 million on securing a property, according to luxury property agents Beauchamp Estates. Their research shows that over the past three years Africans have spent over $900 million on luxury residential property in London. "The new international African is very well-traveled," explains Nkontchou. "Educated in the U.S., UK and different parts of Europe their taste is definitely more modern and clean." 'Safe-Haven' Owning a home in post codes like W1 or W8 -- around the corner from Kensington Palace -- means more than having a place to lay your head. These buildings are investments which are expected to gain even bigger value in the coming years. High-end auction house Sotheby's says that foreign investors see London as a "safe haven"  for prime property investments, and ranks the city as the second most important hub for ultra high-net-worth homes. The only spot more important on the planet is New York City. For evidence that London still attracts high-end buyers, look no further than the sale of a penthouse in Mayfair which fetched $40 million earlier this year. Educated thinking . As well as an intelligent investment, many of the African buyers see these houses as a way of maintaining long standing cultural ties with London -- and it's here they want to send their children to school. Harrow, Eton, Cheltenham Ladies College are all among the list of respected institutions that teach the offspring of wealthy Africans. The Nigerian Embassy in London calculates that Nigerian nationals now spend over $446 million per year on fees, tutoring and accommodation at British schools and university. "West African clients are very much driven by the need to educate their children," says Nkontchou. "Education usually means putting the children on an international stage, and that's one reason why this is feeding into the demand for property in London." Indeed, education industry experts ICEF Monitor say there were over 17,500 Nigerians studying in British universities in 2012  -- about 1,000 more than the 2009/10 academic session. And experts are expecting this trend to continue. "Virtually all the transactions are for end use, not rental investment, which indicates that the African buyer market in London has significant room for growth," says Gary Hersham, director at Beauchamp Estates. "African buyers or luxury tenants in London are currently where the Russians and Ukrainians were five years ago. They have the resources and desire to purchase or rental luxury homes in Prime Central London," he adds. "It is going to be the African century."More from Marketplace Africa .
