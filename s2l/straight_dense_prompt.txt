Article: {{ARTICLE}}

You will generate a very short, concise, entity-dense summary of the above Article.

A Salient Entity is:
- Relevant: to the main story.
- Specific: descriptive yet concise (5 words or fewer).
- Novel: not in the previous summary.
- Faithful: present in the Article.
- Anywhere: located anywhere in the Article.

Guidelines:
- Identify the top {{K}} most salient entities before generating a summary.
- Make sure every salient entity is included in the summary.
- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like "the article discusses".
- Summaries should be coherent and self-contained, e.g., easily understood without the Article.
- Be very concise. Do NOT exceed 65 words.

Return a JSON dictionary with keys "entities" and "summary". "entities" should be a list of {{K}} strings.
